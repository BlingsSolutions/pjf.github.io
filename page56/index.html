            <p><b>Chickens and foxes</b><br/>
It's been months since we've seen any sign of the fox, so I figured that the new chicken pen was doing its job.  Sure, a fox could go all the way around the block and jump the back fence, but no fox would ever go to all that trouble, would it?
<p>
Two nights ago, the fox did indeed go to all the trouble of running around the block and over the back fence.  It tried to take a bite out of one of our chickens, who understandably raised a mighty <i>squark</i>!
<p>
It seemed that no sooner had I heard the cry that I had jumped out of bed, ran through the yard, chased off the fox, and rescued our chicken from the water bucket in which she had landed.  Jacinta was kind enough to arrive a few seconds later with a dressing gown.
<p>
So at 3am in the morning I found myself smelling of wet chicken and nursing our oldest and favourite chook (Phoenix) back to health.  Luckily the fox seemed to get a mouthful of feathers but not much else, and the chook's injuries were superficial.  We suspected internal injuries for a while (laboured breathing, coughing and gurgling), but in hindsight she probably just inhaled some water from her drinking bucket.
<p>
Today our injured chicken looks and acts like all the rest, although maybe with a few less feathers on one side when she lifts her wings.  We're spending the weekend errecting wire across the back fence to finish fox-proofing the pen.
<p>
<b>Business</b><br/>
One of our suppliers has just invoiced us for work performed over a year ago (and which we've already paid for), and for work that we explicitly asked them in writing not to do.  I suspect they had simply forgotten we were a client of theirs until we called to obtain some paperwork from them; it appears they have now gone into a flurry of rememberance and catch-up.  The bothersome thing is that they don't seem particularly eager to provide the paperwork I'm after until the 'new' bills have been paid.
<p>
I'll be addressing the issues on Monday to see if we can come to a resolution.  I don't anticipate too many problems, as we have an excellent trail of paperwork, and a fairly clear and straightforward legal remedy if no understanding can be reached.
<p>
The best thing about straightforward legal remedies is that they work extremely well even if you never have to use them.  They don't even need to be mentioned.  The confidence of having one available means a much more stable platform from which to conduct negotiations, and very often that's all which is required.  Most disputes seem to arise out of ingorance or incompetance, and these require more patience and persistance than the intervention of an Ombudsman, or a ruling from a tribunal.  Still, it's good to know the option exists should we ever need it.
<p>
<b>Colds</b><br/>
I was teaching last Thursday and Friday, my class was an interesting mix from government, telecommunications, and outsourcing firms.
<p>
Thursday night and morning I spent with a sore throat that left me almost speechless.  I was worried this would impact my teaching on Friday, but a big box of throat lozenges managed to keep me vocal throughmost of the day.  Feedback from the course was extremely good, with a number of students hanging around afterwards seeking to burn their training budgets and asking what would be the best courses to continue their Perl education.
<p>
Today (Saturday) I instead have a stuffy nose and groggy head, and have spent a lot of time sleeping.  However a small dose of medicine, a good espresso, and a chocolate coated orange slice seems to have improved my condition greatly, so I should be able to continue working on the chook-pen and do some more last-minute editing of a conference paper before bed.

            <p><b>Financial Mathematics</b><br/>
Have just discovered that William Sharpe (of <i>Sharpe ratio</i> fame) has an on-line book on <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/mia/mia.htm">Macro-Investment Analysis</a>.  The book is very user friendly and readable; I stayed up somewhat late last night engrossed in stories of portfolios of stocks and bonds of the fictional Apple Tree Firm.
<p>
An excellent read for anyone interested in financial mathematics and modern portfolio management.

            <p><b>Yes, that's a lovely webpage...</b><br/>
I've been reminded why I should avoid critiquing the HTML of others without first being invited.  Last night I was asked to change a few apache records to reflect changes to a certain sports club, as their website had changed.  Easily done.
<p>
Being a club with which I was once involved, and of which I still have fond memories, I then proceeded to their website to check out the new design.  It looked very crisp and usable.  "Good," I thought.  Then I looked at the HTML.
<p>
I should be used to it by now, but bad HTML still causes me to gasp in horror and back away in fright.  How do you expect anything to parse your code when you close your head tag <i>after</i> your body tag?  What's that style information doing in the middle of the document?  Why are you closing that HTML comment twice?  Don't you even <i>know</i> about the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C validator</a>?
<p>
So I dutifully wrote a very polite and helpful response that while the website does happen to render correctly on my browser, it could do with a few touch-ups in the realm of standards compliance.  This morning I received the following response.

<b>Appropriate journals for layperson Perl articles.</b><br/>
I'm writing a paper and presentation for the <a href="http://www.sage-au.org.au/conf/vic05/index.html">SAGE-VIC Symposium</a> to be held on the 11th March.  I'm giving a talk on web development, particularly on how to be lazy and get HTML::Mason to do all the hard work for you.
<p>
The presentation comes with a paper for the proceedings, and the whole thing is squarely aimed at a technical audience, but not one that necessarily knows Perl.  The paper itself will be a few thousand words, and besides from being suitable for conference proceedings, I feel it could also easily be turned into a journal article.
<p>
My problem is now which journals to approach.  I'd normally have a chat to <a href="http://www.theperlreview.com/">TPR</a>, <a href="http://www.tpj.com/">TPJ</a> and <a href="http://www.perl.com/">perl.com</a>; however, I can't help feeling that readers of these publications will find themselves getting to the end of the article and wondering what happened to all the Perl content.
<p>
The article could be suitable for a more mainstream software development magazine, but I'm really at a loss as to which ones to approach.  I rarely find myself with the time to read 'general developer' periodicals, even though we have picked up a few subscriptions along the way.
<p>
Since one of my goals is to improve the awareness of Perl in Australia and New Zealand, I'll probably start with some of the local publications first.  However I'm quite open to suggestions at this stage.
<p>
I suppose that what I really should be doing is concentrating on finishing the paper and slides, rather than worrying about the medium-term uses of the work.  After all, the conference is barely three weeks away.

            <p><b>Company Tax Time</b><br/>
I'm currently in the process of filling out our company tax return, and I now understand why the ATO provides companies with up to nine months to complete this task.  Put simply, the form is not user friendly.
<p>
Personal tax, even with all the suppliments, is a walk in the park compared to company tax.  Personal tax assumes that you don't have a copy of the taxation act on your desk, or know how <i>attributed foreign income</i> differs from its <i>unattributed</i> counterpart.
<p>
Personal tax provides great refernces to resources that explains all the terms used, whereas with company tax one needs to do much more research.
<p>
The question could be asked: why isn't our accountant handling all this?  Well, despite our accountant doing a good job of establishing the company, they've been fairly silent except for a glossy pamphlet reminding us that they'd love to fill in our personal tax returns.
<p>
In particular they've done nothing to let us know of the approaching company tax deadlines, or even ask for our financial records so they could make a start on completing the return.  I don't imagine most new company directors know when their company tax is due, and rely upon their accountants to tell them.  I was in this case until I got suspicious of the silence.  So in short, our accountants have failed the 'caring' test.
<p>
Given the amount the accountants would have charged for the return, and given that our 2003-04 return is relatively straightforward, we're making a slight profit doing it ourselves, even though I could be spending the time out doing real work.
