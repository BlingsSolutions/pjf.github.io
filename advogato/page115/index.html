            <B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Good hacking.  Added error-checking to all the
stock-fetching functions, stripped silly HTML from returns
by yahoo_europe, fixed a potential bug or two, and updated
all the regression tests.
<P>
Finance::Quote 0.18 is almost ready for release, although
the documentation could do with some re-working.  It'll be
good to get a more stable and reliable copy of the library
out there.

            <B>Banking</b><BR>
I got my card working.  It appears that my bank classifies
my account as a `cheque' account for ATM purposes.  I'm sure
that I'd pressed that button before, but the chances are
another part of my neural machinery corrected my request and
made me press `Savings', instead, because that's what I
always press.
<P>
I now have access to more than $11.90 in cash, and the
coffee is still very good.
<P>
<B>That's not a weed, it's a feature</b><BR>
I'm still surprised at the large untapped and tasty food
supplies we have growing around us.  A large number of tasty
and nutritious plants are hardy and quick-growing.  So hardy
and quick-growing that our society regularly sprays them
with herbicides, roots them up from the ground, or otherwise
tries to eliminate their existance.
<P>
It's hard to go far in Melbourne without encountering
<I>blackberry nightshade</i>, a small plant related to
tomatoes with clusters of small, black, sweet berries and
edible (when cooked) leaves.  The trainline near my house
regularly grows clumps of <I>salsify</i> (aka `oyster
plant') which has tasty young leaves, and a delicious and
thick root similar in size to a large carrot.  I'm drinking
a tea made form it now, but I've also had it in stir-fried
with noodles, and it is positively delicious. 
Unfortuanately, the train lines seem to be sprayed
regularly, making them unsuitable for foraging.  :(  This is
a shame, as I've spotted a relative of the <I>bush
banana</i> growing along the tracks as well.
<P>
The <I>fat-hen</i> in my backyard is going to seed, and has
attracted large numbers of small, seed-eating birds.  This
marvelous plant grew by itself, received no care, watering
or attention, regularly had large chunks pulled off to be
eaten in soups or omlettes, and eventually managed to grow
taller than the house with never a single pest.  The
neighbours chopped the top off it from over the fence
because they found it ugly.  I wouldn't have minded that too
much if they had eaten their harvest rather than left it.
<P>
On reflection I'm very happy with my garden.  It gets either
ignored or eaten, and yet it continues to grow more yummies
without any input from myself.  I don't even need to plant
seedlings, as most of the plants are self-seeded.
<P>
For those interested in further reading on happy gardens and
yummy weeds, I'd recommend <I>Permaculture One</i> by Bill
Mollison et al, and <I>Edible Plants of Australia and New
Zealand</i> by Tim Low.

            <B>The late Mr. Fenwick</b><BR>
What an interesting evening.  Jacinta rang me from Spencer
Street train station asking if I could cycle in and give her
some papers that she left at home.  Sure, I said.   The
train didn't leave for another 25 minutes so I thought I had
plenty of time.
<P>
I arrived with a whole 20 seconds before the train left, and
despite me running up and down the length of the train
looking through the windows, I couldn't spot Jacinta.  :(
<P>
<B>Money, Money Everywhere, But Not A Bank That
Thinks</b><BR>
To top the evening off, I discovered that my new ATM card
wouldn't actually let me access my account.  I don't see
what logic the bank sees in issuing me with a card that
doesn't actually do anything, and being the holiday season I
suspect that I won't be able to find out until Wednesday.
<P>
In the meantime I have the sum total of $11.90, all of it in
small change.  The rest of my money I spent on coffee --
very good coffee -- which more than makes up for my lack of
hard cash.

            <I>Warning:  This diary entry is really boring unless you
care about the board-game Diplomacy.</i>
<P>
<B>Diplomacy</b><BR>
It's been a long time since I've had a good game of <A
HREF=http://www.diplom.org/Welcome.html>Diplomacy</a>, and
so I briefly ventured over to <A
HREF=http://www.diplom.org/>The Diplomatic Pouch</a> to see
how the community was faring.  A while ago Hasbro purchased
Avalon Hill (the publishers of the game), and there was some
concern that <A
HREF=http://devel.diplom.org/Online/judge.html>on-line
games</a> might get the chop.  I'm glad to
see this wasn't the case.
<P>
Read an excellent article on <A
HREF=http://devel.diplom.org/Zine/F1999R/Debate/paradox.html>Eliminating
the Paradox in Diplomacy</a>, and skimmed over the <A
HREF=http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Zine/W1999A/Clarke/paradox_response.html>response</a>
to it.  Lots of good arguments on both sides, but I won't
mention them here.
<P>
I've been thinking of seeing if anyone's interested in
playing a low-turnaround Diplomacy game at work, with maybe
one `turn' (Move+Retreats) per week.  Ian keeps telling me
how much he loves strategy games, so I expect he will join.

            <B>Perl 5.6</b><BR>
Finally got around to reading about the <A
HREF=http://www.perl.com/pub/2000/04/whatsnew.html>new
features of perl 5.6</a>.  Being a bit of a perl nut, some
of the new features really tickled my fancy.
<P>
By far my favourite new feature is <A
HREF=http://www.perl.com/pub/2000/04/whatsnew.html#Weak_References>weak
references</a>, which looks like it might be an effective
asprin to memory-leak headaches.  (Use only as directed.  If
pain persists, please see your debugger.)
<P>
The new <A
HREF=http://www.perl.com/pub/2000/04/whatsnew.html#Miscellaneous_Bits>our</a>
syntax for global various is very cute, and I like it a
lot.  Using <A
HREF=http://www.perl.com/pub/2000/04/whatsnew.html#Lvaluable_Subroutines>
subroutines as lvalues</a> seems weird and bizzare,
incredibly powerful, and slightly dangerous.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
<A HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/brentn>Brent</a> made
a number of excellent changes to Finance::Quote,
particularly in relation to his TIAA-CREF function, and has
even added regression testing checks for his changes.  I'm
now quite certain we're going to get along well as a
development team.  :)
