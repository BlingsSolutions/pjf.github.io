            <B>Wedding</b><BR>
Yup, it's tomorrow.  We've done the rehersal.  We've had a bit  of dinner beforehand.  Jacinta's gone off to her grandmother's place, where's she'll be dressing up and everything tomorrow before the big event.
<p>
I still have to write a speech, although I'm not too worried about that, being a regular public speaker has its advantages.  There's a bunch of work things that I would have like to have done before the day, but they'll have to wait.
<p>
Right now, I'm kicking back, listening to <a href="http://www.di.fm/">some tunes</a>, and just taking it easy.  We've got house-sitters all organised, and all those wedding things, and most things in the business should run themselves.
<p>
Managed to drop my inbox down to less than 150 messages (down from 600).
<p>
<B>Dive Medical</b><BR>
On our honeymoon we're planning on doings lost of diving.  However, I used to be asthmatic.  Uh-oh.  Diving as an asthmatic in Australia is a no-no.  The problem isn't that you may get asthma underwater and you can't use a bronchiodilator (eg, ventolin).  The problem is that asthma means you lose lung capacity, which can mean trapped air.  If you're underwater, and rise to the surface (or to less depth) that air will expand.  If it expands too much, you can pop a lung.
<p>
Popping a lung isn't nice, but not the biggest thing to worry about.  Air in the bloodstream after you've damaged your lung is a much bigger worry.  It can give you an embolism, causing brain damage, permanent paralysis, or death.  That's bad.
<p>
So, you can imagine that my doctor was cautious about even thinking about passing my medical after hearing that I used to have asthma.  I got to visit a respiritory lab to be given bronchioconstrictants (lung-irritants) and my reaction measured.
<p>
The good news is, my reactions were considered to be well within the normal range, and as such I'm considered "fit to dive".  I'm still going to be cautious, an ex-asthmatic is still more likely to have problems than a regular person.  I suspect that if I do feel any tightness of chest underwater, I'll need to go against my regular instincts and ensure that I stay under until it passes.
<p>
<B>Advice to business-owners</b><BR>
If you think that your tech-magician, who's getting married the next day, gives a toss that you've having problems with machines after you've completely disregarded his advice, then you're completely mistaken.  He can deal with your problems any day.  He's only going to get married once.
<p>
Goodwill is like a bank.  You can deposit into it, and you can withdraw from it when things are tough.  But if you try to withdraw from it when it's empty, it's going to end up costing you a lot.

            <B>Stolen Property</b><BR>
The last time I remember somebody stealing from me would have been back when I was in primary school.  Sure, the odd friend may have loaned a book here and there which they forgot to return, but our house has never been burglarized, and I've never been involved in a mugging.
<p>
As such, it was to my great surprise to discover that theives have been at work on our property.  Our lovely silverbeet is almost entirely gone!  Someone's helped themselves to our front vegie patch, and taken the biggest and bestest of our silverbeet leaves.
<p>
If it were any other plant, I probably wouldn't have minded.  We've got plenty of lettuce, heaps of broad beans, lots of peas, and rhubarb everywhere.  But we only had one silverbeet plant, and it was only just reaching the stage where we were ready to pick a few leaves from it.  Now it will be a long time before we can safely harvest from it, as only a few leaves are left.
<p>
<B>Buck's Night</b><BR>
Some last-minute mix-ups resulted in us changing venue for the dinner, but the laser-games afterwards were very successsful and enjoyed by all.  Unfortunately my team got completely owned in the two team-games.  A big congrats up to both Jacinta and <a href="/person/scottp/">scottp</a> who did an excellent job at base-defense.

            <B>Stress</b><BR>
My current level of stress is beginning to interfere with my ability to work effectively.  <i>Everything</i> has to be done before the wedding, and the lack of ability of some people to do tasks to the timelines they have set for themselves has further increased my frustration.
<p>
At this point I really miss being in a regular job, where I can just take a big wad of leave to get married in a relaxing manner, and not have to worry about how everyone else will survive.
<p>
<b>Server Move</b><br>
I have one client who wishes to move a whole rack of servers tomorrow, and is doing so on the understanding that availability of support for the week immediately following the move will be at an all-time-low.  I've provided my professional opinion that it's a very bad idea, but it's going ahead nonetheless.
<p>
No doubt the client will find the matter a learning experience.

Do not mix up your faxmodem and UPS-health serial connectors.  Otherwise your machine may perform an emergency shutdown whenever you receive a fax.

            <B>New Case</b><BR>
Machine transfer to new case went fine.  Small problem of the SCSI controller not wanting to talk for a bit, solved by moving its PCI slot.  The new case is both smaller and better designed.  Fans sit directly in front of the drive bays, and rear and side fans help move a lot of air through the case.  The result is a very cool machine, which makes me happy.  Oh yeah, it's also got a clear plastic side, bright coloured LEDs, and rounded cables.
<p>
It still looks like a mess of cables inside.
<p>
Like most cases, it has plenty of bays to place things, and never enough power connectors to power them.  Good thing I have plenty of splitters.
<p>
<B>RAID</b><br>
Re-inserted drive into array.  Reconstruction occured quickly (2 hrs) and painlessly.  No problems whatsoever.  Wrote proceedures documentation on what to do in a similar situation  if I'm not around, and left the spare drive in the machine to act as a failover disk, although it needs to be manually added  rather than automatically.
<p>
I'd love to add some agressive drive testing to the server's normal health checks.  Currently a bad sector is only found if we hit it by accident.  I want to perform progressive badblock scans (on timed intervals, during periods of low-load) to find badblocks sooner rather than later.
<p>
<B>Nagios</b><BR>
As part of my recreational time today, I wrote a small Nagios plugin to grab hard-drive temperatures, ambient temperature, and CPU temperature, test them for being too hot, etc. etc.  I'm almost reinventing the wheel, but these things are so quick'n'easy to write that I don't mind a great deal.
<p>
<B>Garden</b><BR>
Lots of harvesting from the garden today.  Potatoes, peas, rhubarb, lettuce, turnips, peas and assorted fresh greens were our reward.  I wish I had more time for gardening.
