    <B>Such a busy week</b><BR>
My goodness, this last week has certainly been busy.  Much of my work involved working for a client with a tight deadline.  They had the usual problems involved with a large project, but also had their technical lead relapse with gandular half-way through.
<p>
Yesterday was my last day there -- already well past the project deadline.  Hardly what one would call a relaxing final day at work.
<p>
<B>SCSI Pain</b><BR>
I learnt far too much about SCSI this week.  I recommended to a client they order in a SCSI card for their server, so it could talk to the appropriate SCSI tape drive.  I rather foolishly <i>did not</i> check the drive to see if it was using narrow SCSI, or wide SCSI.  It uses wide SCSI, and we got a narrow controller.
<P>
While apparently all wide SCSI devices are supposed to be able to drop back into narrow SCSI mode, it needs odd cabling and special termination.  I was once told that a ritual sacrifice will improve many SCSI problems, but unfortunately I had left all my chickens at home that day.
<P>
In any case, I'm eating humble pie for a bit, and have arranged for an appropriate wide, dual-channel, SCSI controller, since it's cheaper than the special high-line terminators.
<P>
<B>Busy week, continued</b><BR>
Met with a new client today, 9:30am meeting, went for about three hours.  They want a whole lot of software development work done.  Still at the quotation stage, but they seem very eager.  That will keep both Jacinta and myself very busy for a while.
<P>
Yesterday, I discovered from <a href="/person/scottp/">scottp</a> that the big Melbourne user's group convention is on <i>tomorrow</i>, and <a href="http://melbourne.pm.org/">Melb.pm</a> is short on people.  I'd been missing the mails about it because I wasn't subscribed to the regular mailing list, and is there any chance that I could possibly help out?  So, that's what I'm doing tomorrow, instead of watching movies with Jacinta and <a href="/person/jenni/">jenni</a>.
<p>
Oh, and just then I had a call from the client with the tight deadlines, asking if I felt that coming in to debug code in Sunday was more enjoyable than sleeping.  They were very understanding when I declined.  I'll probably still be visiting them on Tuesday, though.
<p>
<b>Backup weirdness</b><br>
I appear to have one client where the presence of a directory named backtick (`) is interfering with dump(8).  The directory itself gets stored fine, but not anything after it (in asciibetical order).  We're not doing anything odd with passing in a list of files to dump -- just good ol' regular, "here's a filesystem, put it on the tape".  It may actually be that it's dumping fine, but restore can't handle it.
<p>
In any case, I'd expect such weirdness from fancy new backup software, but when your program states that "A dump command appeared in Version 6 AT&amp;T UNIX", you'd expect it to be pretty stable by now.
<p>
We're running a series of tests to try and locate where the problem is occuring (in either dump or restore), and the smallest case needed to reproduce it.  Very disturbing stuff.  Luckily, it only seems to be affecting one directory, and we found the problem before anything in that directory was needed, but it's still disturbing nonetheless.
