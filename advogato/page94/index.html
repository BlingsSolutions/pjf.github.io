            <B>Graphics Tweaking</b><BR>
Working on squeezing a few more FPS out of my machine.  
Discovered the hard way that whilst my Duron 800 is happy 
to run at 8x100MHz, it's unhappy running at 6x133MHz, 
although the later does provide increased memory access 
speeds with my particular motherboard.
<P>
Installing DirectX 8 seems to have attached me to some 
totally poxy FTP site that's crawling along at 4KB/s.  I 
really would have thought that Microsoft would have decent 
mirrors of their software.

            <B>Shadow</b><BR>
Last night Shadow discovered that he could climb over the
carefully constructed barriers to prevent him from getting
behind/underneath the fridge, and so we went a lot of time
looking for him this morning before realising he was back in
his old haunt.  To make matters more fun, he also took a
bite out of yet <I>another</i> phone cord.  Luckily this
bite only took off some of the insulation.  It seems that
phone-cords are thin and flat and hence the same shape as
nice fat grass.  Thank-goodness he's ignored power cords and
CAT5.
<P>
Shadow's become a lot more confident and happy, and does
less running away and more cute little grunting noises to
signal his dissaproval.  Whilst I appreciate his
considerance in pooping behind the toilet door, I really
wish that he'd use his litter tray for that sort of thing.
<P>
Shadow likes dandelion flowers.  So do I, so once again
we're competing for the same foods in the back-yard. 
Luckily there's enough to go around.
<P>
<B>Games</b><BR>
Grabbed myself a copy of the much awaited <I>Black &amp;
White</i>, and spent the weekend playing it.  It's visually
very impressive, quite amusing, and the gesture interface is
something very new and very good.  I do feel that the
gesture interface would be more natural with a dataglove,
but it's certainly very refreshing not to be clicking on
endless sets of icons. In fact, the game doesn't really have
icons.

            <B>Rabbit</b><BR>
Went through two phone cords today thanks to Shadow.  The 
first time we sliced through the cord moving the fridge so 
we could get Shadow out from behind it, and the second time 
Shadow bit through the cord seeing if it was good to eat.
<P>
Shadow is completely toilet trained, except for the little 
mess in the laundry that missed the litter tray, and the 
little mess in the lounge room.  He <I>is</i> toilet 
trained insofar that he hasn't made a mess of the carpet 
yet, although that might be by luck rather than design.
<P>
Shadow has decided that I'm a good person to have around 
when it comes to cats, dogs, and other scary things.  Today 
he heard Jimmy (<a href="/person/kevinl/">kevinl</a>'s dog) and rather 
than running under cover he ran back to sit next to me.  I 
feel quite useful.  :)
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Actually did some code clean-up yesterday, although I have 
a big backlog of mail to get through.  Sorry to everyone 
who's sent me comments, code, or ideas and hasn't heard 
back from me yet.  I am getting there.
<P>
Felt <I>very</i> pleased with myself when apt-get found and 
installed F::Q today.

            <B>Rabbit</b><BR>
We've decided that a good name for our rabbit/lawn-mower is
<I>Shadow</i>, as he actively avoids sunlight.  As a black
rabbit, this makes a lot of sense from a staying
cool/avoiding detection standpoint.
<P>
I'm considering investing in a water-pistol of some sort to
give the local cats a bit of extra encouragement not to
visit.  I've always chased them from the yard as a matter of
course, but now that we have Shadow I need to be
particularly alert.  It's a shame we can't let him roam
unsupervised.
<P>
<B>Jenni</b><BR>
<a href="/person/jenni/">jenni</a> doesn't seem to be updating her diary
at all, so I'll take this moment to do so for her...
<P>
<I>Purchased a house the other day, big three bedroom thing
with gold-embossed walls, marble statues, and landscaped
gardens.  It's much better than PJF's house (which I still
haven't seen yet), although I did have to pay a little extra
for it.  Talking of PJF, now that I have a house and am
feeling so rich I'll have to buy him lunch again.</i>

            <B>Lawn-mower</b><BR>
After much talk of how long the lawn is getting, and after
much prodding from Jacinta, I finally went out and bought
myself a lawn-mower.  It's low-maintance, self-cleaning,
mulches as well as mows, and instead of producing grass
clippings turns them into a high-grade plant fertilizer.  It
can be operated with minimal supervision, has big ears, and
a cute fluffy tail.  We got one in the stylish colour of
black, and I've affectionately called it rabbit.  Except for
one small incident where its bladder control on the doona
left something to be desired, we've been very happy.
<P>
Rabbit's favourite food is grass, favourite game is
go-to-sleep-behind-the-cannas (where it's almost impossible
to retrieve), and has made it quite clear to us that
shredded newspaper is for its litter tray, and most
certainly <I>not</i> a bedding material.  Rabbit likes to
chew on bits of pruned plum-tree.
<P>
I'm trusting Rabbit not to try and take a bite out of my
network connection as I lie under my plum tree and work.
<P>
<B>Ex-work</b><BR>
It would appear that JS, CEO of my previous workplace, has
resigned.  Interesting news.
<P>
<B>Poker</b><BR>
Jacinta and I ran a poker night last week which was quite
successful, and we're doing a similar thing tonight. 
Currently our friends are still a little hesitant to be
playing for money, but I'm sure that we'll be able to
overcome most of them soon.
