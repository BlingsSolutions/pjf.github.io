            <p><b>Smack down an (Australian) spammer/telemarketer today!</b><br />
I'm not fond of spam, and I'm even less fond of telemarketers.  Aggressively pushing unsolicited advertising is a great way to annoy me.  Recently I've become more serious about causing pain to those who'd choose to disturb my peace, and I'd thought I'd share a few ways to make it a little less desirable to be a spammer (including telemarketers).
<p>
Spam, both e-mail and telephone, is cheap, which means that it can still be profitable even if the success rate is really low.  E-mail is <i>really</i> cheap, which is why we see so much of it.  Telephone spam is less cheap, which is why we see less of it.  The best way to reduce the amount of spam for everyone is just to make it less profitable.  We can do that by not actually buying the products and services offered, but you're probably already doing that.  The other way is to make spamming itself more expensive, which is what I'm going to focus on today.
<p>
For general e-mail spam, keeping your machines secured is the first step.  Most spam is sent by networks of zombie machines; hosts that have been compromised and turned into instruments of evil.  This is why you should give a damn about security even if you don't seem to think you have nothing of value on your machine; your resources are much more valuable to an attacker than your collection of cat photographs.
<p>
If you're a system administrator, then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarpit_%28networking%29">tar-pitting</a> can make spam just a little bit more expensive, although most implementations will end up costing you some of your own resources as well.  A good firewall package like <a href="http://firehol.sourceforge.net/">FireHOL</a> can make it easier to <a href="http://firehol.sourceforge.net/commands.html#tarpit">establish tarpits at the kernel level</a> using up practically no resources, although this is only really useful on machines that don't accept legitimate mail at all.
<p>
If you're an <i>Australian</i>, and someone from inside Australia was silly enough to send you spam, you can <a href="https://web.acma.gov.au/secure/complaint_form.htm">report them to the Australian Communications and Media Authority</a>, who have the power to put the spammer in jail.  As an interesting aside, ACMA use <a href="http://bestpractical.com/rt/">Request Tracker</a> to track spam complaints.
<p>
If you're having a problem with telemarketers, then the first thing is to see if there's a <i>Do Not Call</i> (DNC) registry in your country.  Australia <a href="https://www.donotcall.gov.au/">finally has one</a>, and while it could certainly be improved, it's better than nothing.  If you're on the Australian DNC list and receive a telemarketing call, you can <a href="https://www.donotcall.gov.au/complaint1.cfm">lodge a formal complaint</a>.  It will help if you keep the telemarketer on the line to assist you in filling out the details.
<p>
If you can't lodge a complaint, or the telemarketer is being unhelpful, or if you just feel like a bit of fun, then it's always possible to tarpit the telemarketer.  Your goal is to try and keep the telemarketer on the phone for as long as possible, since that will prevent them from calling others who may (potentially) buy the product.  One of the things that makes telemarketing so cheap is that failed attempts to sell are usually very quick; you'll often discover telemarketers who will hang up on you once they realise a sale is not going to be made.
<p>
If you do choose to tarpit a telemarketer, then please be sure to do this nicely; the individual who called you in unlikely to be evil, they're just <i>really</i> unlucky to be working as a telemarketer.  If anything, you should pity them.  Remember, your goal is to make it unprofitable to run a spamming business, not to make the life of a minimum-wage earner more miserable than it already is.
<p>
A typical telemarketer tarpit goes like this:

This will be dull and boring to most people, so I'll keep it short and sweet.  If you're not using Windows, nvidia drivers, and svchost.exe process running RPC services is consuming more CPU than you'd expect, then rejoice, this post is not for you.
<p>
If you <i>are</i> having those problems, then try killing your nvsvc32.exe process, which is an nvidia driver "helper".  If that provides relief, and you experience no problems because of it, you can disable it entirely from Control Panel -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Services -&gt; Nvidia Display Driver Service -&gt; Properties -&gt; Manual.
<p>
For me, I've had no almost ill effects whatsoever.  I can still run fullscreen games.  I can still run Windowed games.  I can still nvidia's incredibly cool keystoning software so I can project slides onto really oddly shaped surfaces.  The only thing I can't seem to do is apply a custom gamma to individual screens; oh, my poor heart bleeds.

Skud <a href="http://infotrope.net/blog/2007/08/23/theres-a-new-perl-blog-in-town/">recently commented</a> that <a href="http://use.perl.org/">use.perl.org</a> is getting a bit long in the tooth, and doesn't have all the swishy swishness that we'd expect in a modern web 2.0 site.
<p>
Well, if you're using Firefox and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">Greasemonkey</a> then you can upgrade use.perl to web 1.01 with the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/11661">use.perl.org technorati and digg enabler</a>.
<p>
Put very simply, the enabler adds a <a href="http://technorati.com/">technorati</a> favourite link to the user info box, and a <a href="http://digg.com/">digg it</a> link to each post.  A <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pfenwick/1210782257/">screenshot</a> is available for the curious.  If you've already got <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">Greasemonkey</a> installed, you can <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/source/11661.user.js">install the enabler now</a>.
<p>
Right now the script is just something I hacked together quite quickly, so suggestions, comments, bug reports, test cases, and patches are all very welcome.
<p>
If you're feeling so inclined, you can even <a href="http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http%3A%2F%2Fpjf.id.au%2Fblog%2F%3Fposition%3D510%26amp%3Bcount%3D1&title=use.perl.org+technorati+and+digg+enabler">digg this</a>.

            <p><b>OSDC Keynote; dopplr and flickr</b><br />
I've just been asked to present the <i>dinner keynote</i> at the <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">Open Source Developers Conference</a> in Brisbane this year.  This is a great honour, and also just a little bit scary.  Not only will I have a hard time approaching the amazing delivery of Damian's keynote last year, the <i>Da Vinci Codebase</i>, but I'll be standing in the way of hundreds of hungry developers eager for their dinner.
<p>
In other news, after a little delay (ironically due to travel) I've accepted <a href="http://infotrope.net/blog/">Skud's</a> invitation to <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/pjf">dopplr</a>.  If you're a dopplr account holder, then feel free to look me up.  If you need an invite, feel free to ask.
<p>
I've also got photographs online from my recent trip to the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pfenwick/sets/72157601596307807/">Walka Water Works</a> near Maitland NSW.  I didn't exactly take the regular tourist route.
