                <B>Work</b><BR>
Dan has returned, and with a beard no less.  As expected,
Dan is showing himself to be a pretty busy guy, and had
requested that we speak to him about nothing but code for
today.  Tomorrow I get to tell Dan about all the fun things
that have been going on while he was away.
<P>
I did a bit of a Dan last Friday, it seems.  When purchasing
things for myself, I almost religiously get receipts.  When
purchasing $100 worth of pizza on behalf of the company, I
forget to get a receipt.  This is going to make getting the
money back a little interesting.  Mind you, I do have a
bunch of witnesses who can personally verify that I came
back with a large tower of pizza which they then proceeded
to consume, so I'm sure I can work something out.
<P>
The Building Committee also elected to have the meeting room
near the dev/systems/support area called the "Daniel
Ingvarson Memorial Lost Article Room" (DIMLAR), in memory of
all the keys/watches/credit cards/wallets/stuff that Dan has
lost in his travels.
<P>
<B>Bad debts</b><BR>
Ghassan Matar, of Hexapods, seems to have completely
dissapeared, along with the money that he owes me.  Luckily
I made him pay for a large sum of the money up front, so I'm
not much out of pocket, and most of the work I did was on
Finance::Quote and which I would have done sooner or later
anyway.
<P>
<B>House-hunting</b><BR>
I have to admit, I really like the house that we've been
looking at.  Jacinta checked with the council, and yes we
can run chickens there.  I've been talking to various banks
and other financial institutions about getting a home loan. 
This is all very exciting, and very scary.  I'm also now
quite aware how much money I have, how much I'm spending,
and how much I'm saving.  Overall that stuff is looking
pretty healthy, although stamp duty and the legal costs of
transferring a house can be quite high.
<P>
<B>Diplomacy</b><BR>
Getting very interesting.  Junwei and I are very good
friends, which is why I've been kicking his butt out of
neighbouring provences.  Phil and I are also good friends,
which is why he tried to invade me last turn.  I'm also good
friends with England, so good friends that he's letting my
troops stay in his capital city.  Everyone's my friend.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Been doing absolutely nothing recently, which sucks.  Been
spending all my time looking at houses, looking at home
loans, cooking dinner, and defending France from the Italian
hordes.
<P>
<B>Chickens</b><BR>
Chickens are way cool.  If we move to Preston, I can keep
six of them, but I'll probably start with five.  I've
decided to call them Ben, Tara, Ian, Sofie, and Daniel.

I'd like to thank <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/fozbaca>fozbaca</a> for
his tips and how things look from the smoker's side of
things.  Unfortunately Kathryn tells me that she's given up
on giving up, which is a shame -- a week and a half with no
cigarettes is a very good start.
<P>
If Kathryn does decide to start again, I can feel safe in
the knowledge that I won't put any deadlines in front of
her.  Kathryn's job, as a member of the Support team, is to
put work in front of me.  (I've been doing a good job of
dodging it, though.)
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Linas has greatly increased the traffic on the mailing list
with some great ideas about historical quotes and non-http
quotes.  I've got lots of good things to be thinking about
now.  Linas even wants to do the web-page. I'm a happy boy.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
The company sponsored pizza, the employees purchased a huge
amount of drinks, and a good time was had by all.  I even
played a little <A
HREF=http://www.counter-strike.net>Counter-Strike</a>, but
quickly
stopped because Windows is just so damn annoying.  That and
Natedawg is too good and keeps whipping my butt.
<P>
Monday is a public holiday (yay!), and Tuesday Dan is due
back.
<P>
<B>Diplomacy</b><BR>
My goodness, due to popular demand we're going to start a
<i>third</i> play-by-e-mail <A
HREF=http://www.diplom.org/>Diplomacy</a> game here at
work.  It's amazing how much people are getting into it. 
Sometimes I think Ben speaks the truth when he says that
I've destroyed productivity with my silly strategy games.

I wish <A

all the best in giving up smoking.  Hang in there.
<P>
<B>House-hunting</b><BR>
Like <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/aaronl>aaronl</a>, I
also went looking at houses today.  Unlike aaronl, I was
looking at small 2 bedroom places, rather than ones with 16
fireplaces and a T1.
<P>
I didn't expect to be looking at houses at this time of
year, but this one in particular happened to catch my eye. 
It's in Preston (not <I>too</i> far from the city), has lots
of land, and is quite affordable.  The only problem is that
the house itself is quite small.  It should be fine for
Jacinta and myself to live there, but if Gwen were to move
in as well it would be rather cramped.
<P>
I'm going to arrange for a second inspection and if we still
like it we'll throw them an offer and see what they say.  I
would very dearly like to own my own house, and this place
certainly has enough space for livestock and vegetables to
keep me happy for a while.
<P>
<B>Melbourne geeks -- two degrees of separation</b><BR>
It seems that every geek I meet in Melbourne is related to
every other geek by at most one other person.  <A
HREF=http://www.glasswings.com.au/attendants.html>Katherine</a>
had her birthday party last night, and I met a girl there
named Nicole.  She ended up knowing me from when I worked at
the University of Melbourne, and I ended up knowing her
partner from when I was a student.

                <B>Smoking</b><BR>
I have an interesting dilemma at work.  Our new support
person, Kathryn, is an unsuccessful ex-smoker.  She gave up
for a while, but she's now buying and smoking cigarettes
again.  Since she wants to give up, I'd like to help Kathryn
beat her habit.  Unfortunately, it's hard to argue with
complete and utter unthinking physical addiction, and
nicotine addiction is about as strong as it gets.
<P>
I've never smoked, I've never had the desire, and I don't
intend to start.  I have had a family member die a painful
and protracted death from a smoking related illness, and I
don't think that experience is something I will ever
forget.  I can't think of very many worse ways to die.
<P>
I'm not an anti-smoking zealot, but if someone wants to give
up, then I'm seriously very happy to help them.  My dilemma
is that I don't know how.  I've tried taking Kathryn's
cigarettes, but she just buys more.  I've even offered to
trade her cigarettes for lollies and sugary things (Kathryn
has a sweet-tooth).  Alas, no luck so far.

<A HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/sw>Sam</a> managed to
find the REAL bug-of-doom that I had spent so long looking
for.  It ended up that our daemon had opened a couple of
unix-domain sockets before forking, and the children
inherited and used the open file descriptors.  Due to the
nature of the code this was okay during quiet periods, but
caused huge problems during load.  Sam was presented with
the Bugfinder's Beer and everyone is happy.  Good work Sam!
<P>
<B>Diplomacy</b><BR>
Very interesting turn.  It seemed that everyone lied to
everyone, and a very messy turn was had by all.  What fun! 
I'm looking forward to see how it all turns out.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
I'm very thankful to Jacinta for her work.  She's spent a
lot of time cleaning up code, making sure things are
consistant, and reviewing my hacker's guide and other
documentation.
<P>
I'm playing with Debianising Finance::Quote, although it
will probably be a while before I get the proper hang of
it.  I've got some examples to work by, so I'm using them.

<B>Cartooning</b><BR>
I'm once again walking the fine line and have restarted my
