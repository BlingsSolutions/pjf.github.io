            <B>GnuCash</b><BR>
Seems the reason why the GnuCash mailing list has been so
quiet recently is that I was somehow dropped off the list
with a number of other developers.  This is very odd.
<P>
Dave reminded me that GnuCash is going into a feature freeze
on Sunday, so it looks like Saturday I'll be coding and
rolling.
<P>
Unfortunately the latest GnuCash from the CVS tree seems to
have a couple of bugs that are making double-entry
impossible.  Since double-entry is the best thing since
sliced accountants, I might have to return to the previous
version for a little while.
<P>
<B>Food</b><BR>
Jacinta's liver cleansing diet is doing wonders... I arrive
home each night to a well planned and almost prepared meal. 
Jacinta's even doing the dishes for me so that she has
things to cook with.  I wonder when she'll realise that if
she's doing the cooking then I guess I should be doing the
cleaning...  I hope she doesn't, because I hate cleaning. 
Maybe I can convince Gwen to do the cleaning instead?

            <B>Hackey-sack</b><BR>
The Vice-President of Marketing now plays hackey-sack.  This
is a good thing.  Mind you, it's not too surprising,
either.  AJ also plays Half-Life and Diplomacy.
<P>
<B>TPJ</b><BR>
Received an e-mail from Jon Orwant asking if I'd be
interested in writing an article for <A
HREF=http://www.itknowledge.com/tpj/>The Perl Journal</a>
about Finance::Quote.  I tried to send a more intelligent
reply than just "<I>Hell Yeah!</i>", which was my initial
response.
<P>
<B>Bugs</b><BR>
Damn hisenbugs resurrecting themselves.  Unfortunately
finding bugs that only occur "infrequently, and for no good
reason" is a very tricky process.
<P>
<B>Gardening</b><BR>
Compost heap is full.  A year's worth of hard work has
turned foodscraps and garden waste into a huge amount of
beautiful vermicast (worm poo).  The effects of this stuff
is impressive, but my supply outstrips my demand at my
current property (tiny back-yard).
<P>
I'd love to move somewhere with more space, but I don't want
to go from rented property to rented property.  This
probably means I should start looking at houses again, and
maybe re-evaluating my financial situation since Gwen is
living with us now.  Mind you, I have no idea how long Gwen
will be staying, so any calculations I make should err
strongly on the side of caution (then again, they always
do).

            <B>Liver-Cleansing Diets</b><BR>
Jacinta has recently started the liver-cleansing diet (LCD),
which <A HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/rcp>Ross</a>
seems to have had good success with.  I'm often skeptical of
diets (there are too many "fad diets" which are quite bad),
but a bit of research shows that the LCD appears to be quite
sensible.
<P>
One thing which made me very happy is that I can feed
Jacinta lots of wild herbs that I've collected because the
diet recommends them as healthy and healing foods.  I don't
think I could have ever convinced Jacinta to drink dandelion
tea or eat fresh sowthistle otherwise.
<P>
<B>I am Fabio -- the most beautiful man in the world</b><BR>
I've been doing my <A
HREF=http://search.corbis.com/default.asp?i=11330682&vID=1&rID=101>Fabio</a>
look (beautiful brown curly hair
waving over my shoulders) the last couple of days.  While
this seems to have gained the appreciation of the Support
team at Schoolsnet, it's also brought back an old problem of
mine -- gender misidentification.
<P>
It seems that whenever I've freshly shaved, people seem to
get my gender wrong. Last night it was the taxi driver, in
the past it's been shop assistants, waiters, and a variety
of others.  This gets mildly annoying, because I am actually
male.
<P>
I've considered growing a beard a few times, but I've found
that (1) it itches when I try to grow a beard, and (2) my
beard grows only in spots and looks really stupid.  So much
for that idea.
<P>
<B>Rockclimbing and Comedy</b><BR>
Karen came rockclimbing with us on Sunday, and generally had
a fun time once she had got past a few teething problems
with the belay harness.  With luck she should become a
regular climber.  Afterwards some of us went to a comedy
show in South Melbourne, which was very enjoyable. 
Unfortunately Karen seems to have picked up a bit of a cold
from the whole experience.
<P>
My private health insurance say that they'll pay for 70% of
my rockclimbing fees.  I'm sending them off a claim today to
see if they keep good to their promise.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
We have a hackers guide.  :)
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
New people, every day.  We have a new person in the Support
team who I haven't met yet.

I'd love to go back to cartooning -- there is so much
material at Schoolsnet to base a strip on.  The only problem
is that while it's very funny to me, someone (possibly me)
might get sued if I were to put it all into stick-figures
and speech-bubbles and release it to the world.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
My goodness, I have 90 minutes all to myself to hack code. 
This is a very very good thing.  Hopefully I can get a good
amount of framework testing done, tidy up the backwards
compatibility bits I'm not 100% happy with, and maybe even
start on a hackers guide.  I very much want a hackers guide
to make it easy for people to write new modules.
