            <B>Herbal Teas</b><BR>
Sofie thinks my newest herbal tea smells like bong-water. 
She still drank some of it, so it couldn't have been that
bad.
<P>
<B>Private health cover</b><BR>
Spent a good chunk of the day comparing various private
health insurance packages.  The Australian government is
going to charge me a big slab of money for earning chunks of
cash but not getting private insurance, so I'm hoping to
rectify that shortly.
<P>
What worries me is how much the government is pushing
private health insurance.  All Australians are entitled to
free public health insurance, called Medicare.  Higher
income earners pay a Medicare levy to help pay for this, the
even higher income earners pay an extra levy if they don't
have private insurance.
<P>
Recently the government has introduced a 30% government
rebate on private health insurance.  This, combined with the
extra levy that was recently introduced, is a big incentive
for the higher-earners to get private insurance.  That's all
fine with me, but I'm a little worried that it might be the
start of a "ramping-down" of public health cover.  I don't
want to see Australia increase the rift between the medical
services available to the rich and the poor.

            <B>Work (bug)</b><BR>
Found the nasty bug that we were being caned about for the
last few days.  Many thanks goes to Humpy who helped track
down the offending chunk of code.  I think half the office
must have heard my bug finding, and a couple of them got
hugs because I was so happy.
<P>
If you're planning on writing software which I'm going to
have to debug, and want to save me a large amount of mental
grief, please try to adhere to the following rules:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Do it properly the first time, instead of marking the
code as "broken" and then never coming back to it.
<LI>Follow the relevant written standard, be it a RFC or
otherwise.
<LI>Think very hard about what happens in error cases.  Even
though you might not expect anything to go wrong, it will. 
Program very defensively.
<LI>Before using a program as part of a critical piece of
software, at least take the time to read the man-page.
</ul>
<P>
While not all of the above were a factor in this bug, I've
had to fix more than my fair share of bugs caused by them.
<P>
Me?  I've got to remember that when I do testing to try and
use exactly the same environment as the "real thing".  A
couple of hours could have been saved bug-hunting if I had
realised the software I was using for testing had been
patched to ignore SIGPIPEs.
<P>
<B>Fun</b><BR>
Had a great party last night, with many good friends over. 
DanielG brought over a beautiful bottle of port, which
Jacinta and I now have all to ourselves because everyone
else thought it was something other than port.  :)
<P>
<B>Work (Michelle)</b><BR>
Michelle, our office manager, left for greener pastures
yesterday.  We gave her our best wishes and farewells at a
nearby pub.  Michelle had been working at Schoolsnet for a
very long time, and has been responsible for many essential
processes and proceedures.  Her smiles and good nature will
be sorely missed.  I wish Michelle all the very best in her
new career.
<P>
<B>Tea</b><BR>
After getting directions from Junwei, I now have a good
supply of cyrsantheum (spel?) tea.  Yum!
<P>
<B>Work (Building Committee)</b><BR>
I've been elected on to the new building committee at work. 
There's a large amount of politics surrounding this, and I'm
rather honoured that my team has decided that I should
represent them.
<P>
<B>Sofie</b><BR>
Sofie's started at Schoolsnet, and we're working on
introducing her to the joys of hackey-sack.  Sofie is also a
trained masseuse, and I'm very thankful to her for helping
me relax after a nasty day of bug-hunting.
<P>
<B>Ian</b><BR>
Ian's a sweetie, and I'm glad that he cares about me so
much.  He's also picking up my (now fixed) television on
Monday.  What a guy!

            <B>Work</b><BR>
Just call me bug-boy again.  Caught a good specimen of a
nasty bug I've trying to track for weeks, and if I can't fix
the cause I think I can treat the symptoms.
<P>
Also have Support going after some nasty bugs that have
become more public recently.  Again these are hard ones --
the source is unknown, but the symptoms might be treatable
as well.
<P>
I'm afraid that John (our CEO) is regressing back to his
previous corporate lifestyle, and has lost some of the
laid-backness we had instilled him with.  We might have to
try aversion therapy on him or something.
<P>
<B>Diplomacy</b><BR>
Fun to play, fun to watch.
<P>
<B>Hackey-sack</b><BR>
What a violent game.  I sustained another hackey injury
today.  I don't like playing hackey in shoes, but it can
hurt when you're trying to steal the hack off someone who
is.

            <B>PowerTweak: Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Managed to get the all-modular, all-pluggable Finance::Quote
written over the weekend.  It's fully backwards compatible
with version 0.18, is a lot nicer to look at, provides
failover support, and makes it much much easier for people
to write pluggable modules that will work under the
framework.  I'm happy.

            <B>Time</b><BR>
I love spending time doing all sorts of things, but I never
seem to be able to get enough of it.  Friends, food, coding,
a life, family, geeky things, sleep -- I want time for them
all.
<P>
Back when I was a student I used to run on a 25 hour day. 
This was very good, because I'd always have that extra hour
to do things in.  I can't do this anymore, because I need to
come in at a semi-reasonable time for work.
<P>
Am going to try and crystalise a number of ideas in my head
into code, despite it being past my bedtime of 10:30.  I'm
really going to have to find a way to do more open-sourcey
things at work.  I'm a sucker for people sending me patches.
<P>
<B><I>Addendum</i></b><BR>
Stayed up until sometime in the morning hacking at
Finance::Quote.  I've got a working framework for proper
failover, loadable module support, and more configurable
objects.  Plus I think I can keep everything compatible with
the old calling syntax with just a little work.  This makes
me all very happy.
<P>
The changes aren't in the CVS tree yet, because they're not
finished and break just about everything.  I want to clean
them up and gain comments from the other developers before I
put them back in the main branch.  In the meantime I might
put them on an experimental branch.
<P>
If I were a few years younger I'd probably pull an
all-nighter to convert everything over to the new harness,
but at the ripe old age of 23 I'm finding I need my sleep. 
In any case I'm still a very happy coder.
