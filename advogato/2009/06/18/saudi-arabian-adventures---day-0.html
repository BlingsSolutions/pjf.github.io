    <p><b>Saudi Arabian Adventures - Day 0</b><br>
<i>The events in this entry occurred on the 11th/12th June</i><br>
<p>
At the start of this year, Kirrily "Skud" Robert
<a href="http://infotrope.net/blog/2009/01/01/new-years-resolutions/">made
a remark</a> about new year resolutions that are easy and fun to keep.
As an example, she included "never turn down an adventure".
<p>
While I'm not one to make (or keep) new year resolutions, this one
stuck in my mind as a particularly good one to have.  While it's certainly
been a <i>fun</i> resolution, I disagree about it being easy to keep.
It's this particular resolution that had me stripping off to go swimming
in <a href="http://pix.cafuego.net/main.php/v/Marchsouth/dsc_0003.jpg.html">
waters of unknown depth, quality, and temperature</a> when travelling
around Tasmania with <a href="http://cafuego.net/">Peter</a>,
<a href="http://kattekrab.net/">Donna</a> and
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~jarich/journal/">Jacinta</a> after
<a href="http://lca2009.linux.org.au/">Linux.conf.au</a> this year.
<p>
The same resolution of "never turn down an adventure" now has me in
Saudi Arabia, giving a Perl course to the world's largest oil company.
It would have been easy for me not to be here.  As it happens, I arrived
only a day before my entry visa expired.  The amount of legwork
required to set up a trip like this for the first time is quite
considerable, and actually started back in Feburary!  So far, it certainly
has been an adventure.
<p>
It started with my flight from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai">Dubai</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dammam">Dammam</a>.  Emirates was kind
enough to upgrade me to business class, which was nice, and meant a
very comfortable flight.  At the end of the flight I
leisurely strolled off the plane and through the airport, looking
at the scenery and taking my time.  When I rounded the last corner,
I immediately realised I had made a terrible mistake.  Despite the
flight having lasted only an hour, I had flown internationally, with
hundreds of other people.  There would be passport control and
customs.  These things are rarely quick, and one <i>really</i> wants
to be at the front.
<p>
I found myself about three-quarters down the back of a queue, with
only a small number of passport control officers.  I noticed that
processing each person took a <i>long</i> time, maybe five minutes or
more, as they needed document checks, and fingerprints, and
photographs, and sometimes a short interview, and (if they looked
unwell) a check by doctors concerned about swine flu.  It was about
10pm at night, and after counting the people in front of me, and doing
some maths, I estimated I would be through passport control at
approximately 2am!
<p>
As luck would have it, another passport control officer was put on
duty, and I managed to get through customs after only a
three-and-a-half hour wait.  There was then a rather ominous moment
of me realising that while there were lots of drivers waiting with
signs and people's names, none of them held <i>my</i> name.  Luckily,
my driver had only gone to get a cup of tea (quite understandable
after 3.5 hrs waiting!), and we met after only a few minutes of me
wandering about looking lost.
<p>
After chatting a bit with the driver, I must admit that I slept
most of the trip to the hotel.  It seemed to involve the single
longest stretch of road possible; I woke up a few times, and we
were still on the same highway.  It also had what I could only
describe as christmas-tree lights strung along the edges (so one
didn't drive off into the desert), and all the electronic signs
(eg, roadwork ahead) were animated in such a way that if one
ever appeared in my web-browser, I would immediately add it to my
block-list.
<p>
After going through a number of security checkpoints (which I would
later learn are required for all entry and exits to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Aramco_Residential_Camp_in_Dhahran">Aramco campus</a>),
I finally arrived at my hotel.  This felt like being in America;
it had American power points, all the light-switches were the wrong
way around, and the lamps have these funny knobs that I keep turning
the wrong way.
<p>
At this point, most people would fall asleep, exhausted.  However I'm
equipped with the geek version of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow's
hierarchy of needs</a>, so the first thing I did upon arriving
was wake up the poor reception staff so I could be connected to
the wireless network, and <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/5205857">dent/tweet</a>
that I had arrived.
