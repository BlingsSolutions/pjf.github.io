            <B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
<A HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/brentn>Brent</a>'s
TIAA-CREF patches have been merged into the Finance::Quote
source and a new version released.  It can be found on the
<A
HREF=http://www.sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=4232>Finance::Quote
webpage</a> as version 0.17.
<P>
I'll integrate the changes into GnuCash shortly.
<P>
<B>Advogato</b><BR>
Advogato's trust metric seems a little weird.  Previously I
was certified as an Apprentice.  Now more people have
certified me (all at either Apprentice or Journeyer) but my
rating has dropped down to Observer.
<P>
I guess I'm going to have to read <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/trust-metric.html>the document
on trust metrics</a> to figure out why a single
Certification from <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/dancer>Dancer</a> can
make me an apprentice, but 5 Journeyer/Apprentice
certifications can drop me back to Observer...  It all seems
very bizzare.

            <B>Work</b><BR>
A Friday.  I figured everything would be pretty good.  Have
the morning meeting, drink a coffee, kick-back and leisurely
iron out a few stray bugs here and there.  Not the case.
<P>
This morning Dan called me in the middle of breakfast.  Told
me there was a problem.  Told me that bad things were
happening.  I told him that I'd be there shortly.
<P>
Cycled in, figured out the most likely cause of the problem
on the way in.  Came into work and discussed bugs with all. 
I suggested that one of the auxillary libraries which fixed
many of the bugs hadn't been upgraded.  We checked.  It had
been.  However, the main program itself wasn't upgraded to
the bugfixed version.  That would explain everything.
<P>
Made sure that all was upgraded properly, went to the
morning meeting, drank my coffee, kicked-back for some
bug-hunting and got emergency sticky-noted by Dan again. 
Apparently the bugs were back, and 10 times worse.
<P>
Went to lunch (being pretty hungry after being called away
from breakfast), came back, looked at errors.  No, there
were not 600 errors, there were only 8.  There were 592
instances of the server having a high-load and asking
clients to retry later.
<P>
Scott told Dan the good news (the mountain becomes a
molehill), and Dan looks like he's about to kiss one of us. 
I like Dan, but not that much.  Besides, he's getting
married in a couple of weeks.
<P>
Get back to my office, relax, tracked down the bug that was
causing the last 8 errors.  The bug was where we thought it
was all along, except that we'd always find other, bigger
bugs when we were looking for it.  This should be the final
battle of me verus The Obscure Bug, and with luck I should
win.
<P>
To make the day even more weird, Dan and the Systems team
have all gone off on `SysTrek' to discuss `Systems
Matters'.  This has pretty much killed our targets for
Half-Life tonight.
<P>
Rumour has it that performance reviews will be finished on
Monday.  I don't believe that will happen, but if they
aren't finished by next week we'll have to cancel Dan's
wedding.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Someone's grabbed it and worked on it and will be sending me
a patch shortly.  Mmmm....  Rapid development...
<P>
<B>Advogato</b><BR>
After re-reading the Advogato ratings I've re-certified
myself up to Journeyer.  Personally I feel I'm about
half-way between the levels at the moment, but as yet we
don't have a rating for that.  Mind you, the Meta article
seems to be suggesting we might have one soon.

My goodness!  Less than 24 hours and 125 people have
downloaded the source, triple that have visited the
webpage.  Freshmeat is a wonderful thing.

            <B>Health</b><BR>
I'm feeling <I>much</i> better now (compared to the previous
few days).  As such I spent a day at work and even wrote
useful code.  This is much better than what happened on
Tuesday, where I spent most of the day in a zombie state.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
It's out there, and I've told people about it.  I've made a
file release on <A
HREF=http://www.sourceforge.net/>SourceForge</a>, submitted
details to <A HREF=http://www.freshmeat.net/>Freshmeat</a>,
and will be releasing on CPAN shortly.  With luck I'll get a
number of comments, bug reports, and desired features back. 
Possibly a few flames as well.
<P>
<B>Ian</b><BR>
Ian's really getting into the whole
SysAdmins-with-weapons-thing.  I think this was something
that he was never allowed to do at DECR because of the
students, and at his conslutancy job because of the
customers.  Hopefully his aim will get better in time.  He
doesn't scare me at all yet.
<P>
<B>Ian/Rockclimbing</b><BR>
Ian wants me to go rockclimbing with him tonight.  I want to
go too, but I'm very aware of how little awareness I have of
my surroundings with this virus on me.  I don't want to risk
me being dangerous to either Ian or myself.

Hah!  It's easy to make money from Open Source.  With the

with some tricky financial choices that are just around the

<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
<A
HREF=https://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=4232>Finance::Quote</a>
is now available on Sourceforge.  Hooray.  The code in the

packagey thing out shortly for CPAN...  When I'm feeling
better.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Went to work today because I'm feeling much much better than
I was over the weekend.  Many people used colourful
expressions to describe
how I looked, and a number have encouraged me to go home
early and get some rest.  That sounds like a pretty good
idea.
<P>
Ian's at work now, with new cute little glasses. 
Unfortunately I wasn't feeling well enough to give him a
proper welcome to the company (nerf guns, whipped cream and
bondage), so he's managed to escape his first few days here
with some scraps of dignity.  I'm sure I'll be able to fix
that in time.
