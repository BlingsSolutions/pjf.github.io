            <p><i>Portland Adventures</i><br>
Last year I went to <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/toc.html?tag=oscon2008">OSCON 2008</a> in Portland, Oregeon (PDX), and had a fantastic time.  I made many great friends, and fell in love with the town and its people.  I was looking forward to returning to PDX every year, but unfortunately this year OSCON moved to San Jose.
<p>
Not to be denied the Portland experience by mere conference shifts, I arranged to arrive in America a week early, and re-visit PDX the week before OSCON.  I'm here right now with <a href="http://use.perl.org/~jarich/journal/">Jacinta</a>, and have had an incredibly social time with friends both old and new.
<p>
We've been staying with <a href="http://www.chesnok.com/">Selena</a> who has been nothing short of amazing.  Accommodation, network access, food, transport, good coffee, and most of all fantastic company have made me feel extremely privileged.  Selena knows <i>everyone</i>, and is incredibly popular, so we get invited to all the cool events too!  I've met more people in the last two days than I can possibly count.  Selena also has a beautiful house; and I'm currently sitting under a tree, next to a pond, with a fountain, fish, power, and wireless.  I could happily make this my new office.
<p>
I've had a chance to catch up with <a href="http://www.katealaurel.com/">Kate</a> and <a href="http://schwern.org/">Schwern</a>, who caught me on the night I landed in PDX for gelato and conversation.  Hanging with Kate and Schwern is like fractal socialising; I'll meet someone, discover we have common interests, they'll introduce me to someone else, and the process repeats.  It was only at 2am when I was talking to Kate's house-mate's boyfriend about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_the_gathering">Magic: The Gathering</a> that my body reminded me that I hadn't slept in a real bed for more than 48 hours, and that passing out in the middle of a conversation would probably be considered impolite.
<p>
Yesterday I went to the Portland Pirate Shop with the intention of picking up a puffy white shirt, and was informed that I had just missed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plunderathon">Plunderathon</a>, and that all the puffy shirts are gone, so I was doubly sad.  Next year I'll need to make sure to arrive in PDX much earlier, so I can participate in costumed piratical goodness.
<p>
Picking what to do in the evening was hard.  Portland seems to be the place where on a Thursday night one needs to choose between a mountain-biking festival, PostgreSQL user-group, Perl hackathon, and <a href="http://www.igniteportland.com/">Ignite Portland</a>.  It's a great place to be a geek.  ;)
<p>
In the evening I made it to Ignite, which I've decided that I <i>have</i> to speak at if I get the chance.  The audience is relaxed, friendly, looking to be entertained, and all have beer.  The talks were pretty good, too.  I even met one person who recognised me from my work on the Perl 5.8.9 release notes.
<p>
Afterwards I made it to the tail end of the hackathon, drank <a href="http://justatheory.com/">David's</a> beer at a pub that had a huge number of board-games, and retired back to Selena's with Schwern and Jacinta, where we talked late into the night about all sorts of Perl community ideas, including a cute little plan involving community achievement badges that I like to think of as "Perl Scouts". ;)

            <p><i>These are the last of my Arabian Adventure blogs, which means I'm now caught up with my blogging backlog in time for OSCON.</i>
<p><b>Saudi Arabian Adventures - Day 6</b><br>
Today was my last day of teaching, and a challenging one.  I had
more variation in students backgrounds and skills for this
class, which always makes teaching more interesting.  Lots of
practical examples seemed popular, so they were the main fare
for the day.  It's easy to show off Perl's strengths when working
with text.
<p>
During my week in Saudi Arabia I've discovered a few interesting
things.  While Saudi Arabia as a country fares poorly with
women's rights, it's clear that Aramco as a company (or this campus,
at least) was very progressive.
<p>
Women aren't allowed to drive on public roads in Saudi Arabia.
As one of my colleagues put it, "we're hoping that will change
soon, but we've been hoping twenty years".  However the Aramco
campus isn't public, and so there's no problem with women
driving inside.  Likewise, Aramco recruits the brightest
girls from high school.  They go through an English
language program, and are then sent overseas (usually America or
Europe), to earn their degree.  They're required to work for
Aramco for an equal period to the time they spent studying overseas,
although it appears most continue working well beyond that.  It
sounds like an almost identical scheme to what Australia has with
some defence force scholarships.
<p>
On my class I had three women out of twenty-four students overall,
which is on par for what we get for courses conducted
inside Australia.  I fear the gender imbalance in IT is a worldwide
problem.

            <p><b>Autodie 2.00 released</b><br>
This weekend the long awaited <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?autodie">autodie 2.00</a> for
Perl was released to the CPAN, which was almost immediately replaced
by 2.02, which fixes some oopsed tests and which adds a couple more features to
give us a really sweet experience.  This blog entry assumes you're
using 2.02.
<p>
Observant viewers will notice that the major version number has
changed.  I've taken the great leap from 1.999 to 2.00.  Clearly,
something is different, and you might be wondering what.
<p>
Well, autodie 2.0 now supports a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?autodie::hints">hinting
interface</a> for user-defined subroutines.  Put simply, if you have a
user-defined subroutine that does something funny to signify failure,
you can now tell autodie about that.  Once it knows, it can Do The
Right Thing when checking your subroutine.  You can even put the hints
into the same file as those subs, and if someone is using autodie
2.00, it will find the hints and use them.
<p>
This may not sound very exciting, but it is.  It means that a lot of
really ugly error-checking code, both on the CPAN and the DarkPAN, can
go away.  Lexically.  Still not convinced this will change your life?
Let's look a little more closely; trust me, you'll like it.
<p>
Let's pretend you're working on a piece of legacy code.  For some
reason, the people who wrote this code decided the best way to
signal errors is by returning the list <tt>(undef, "Error
message")</tt>.  I don't know why, but I've seen this anti-pattern
emerge independently in <i>three</i> 100k+ line projects I've been
involved in.
