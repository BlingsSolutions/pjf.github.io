    <B>It's not just a house, it's an adventure</b><BR>
Got the keys to the house on Monday.  It rained all day,
which made me less enthusiastic about the whole deal of
cycling over to the real-estate agent and the house, but I
finally bit the bullet when I realised that the rain was
just not going to stop.
<P>
Yup, the house was still there and much as we left it. 
Spent about 90 minutes in the sogging rain doing things in
the garden, and decided that it was getting a bit dark and
started to head home.
<P>
Being wet and dark, and the roads a bit slippery, I decided
to take the Merri Creek trail -- a very scenic and relaxing
ride.  Lots of signs up saying "WARNING - Path subject to
flooding", but no actual signs of flood.  Sure, the water
was high, but it wasn't covering the path.
<P>
Nearing St Georges Road, which I would cut through to get
home, I passed a cyclist coming the other way.  She asked if
the path ahead of flooded.  I told her that no, it was fine,
and we went our seperate ways.  Once I got around the
corner, I realised that she was telling <I>me</i> that the
path was flooded, as the creek had broken its banks and
completely covered the path.
<P>
"Doesn't look very deep," I think to myself as I cycle into
the water.  Sure enough, it's only a couple of inches,
although it seems to go on for a long way.  "I'm surprised
that ducks can swim in water this shallow," I think to
myself just before I hit the dip in the path and find the
water level above the top of my wheels.
<P>
I had ducks swimming on either side of me as I continued to
cycle, with most of my bicycle underwater.  The ducks didn't
quite know what to think of me.  :)
<P>
The rest of the trip home went without mishap, although my
bike now has a "high water mark" which makes it quite
obvious how deeply it was underwater.
<P>
Haven't seen much rain today, so if all goes well I'll check
on the house tonight to make sure it's still standing.  Our
first few things (mainly gardening equipment) will be moved
this weekend.
