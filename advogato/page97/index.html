            <B>Smoking</b><BR>
Kat's giving up smoking, not having had a cigarette in four
days now.  She's holding me to my promise to sponsor her for
$2/week for a year, with her paying me back double if she
starts again.  Gill's also giving up.  This is excellent
news, I like my friends and workmates not smoking.  :)

            <B>TPJ</b><BR>
Yay, issue #19 is finally on the web.  This means I finally
get to read <a href="/person/mojotoad/">mojotoad</a>'s article, as well as
my own of course. :)
<P>
<B>Climbing</b><BR>
Went rock-climbing for the first time in ages today.  My
fingers and arms are a little sore, but the mexican
afterwards sure
tasted good.  Got to see Dan G who I haven't seen
in ages and had been missing.  Chatted to him lots about
geeky things like Java, roguelike games, PBMs, and ducks. 
Good fun.

            <B>Warboid World</b><BR>
Just got a letter from Peter giving me his blessings to
resurrect Warboid World under an open source license.  It
looks like the license for the server-engine may end up
being QPL.  I expect the clients for playing the game will
be under whatever license their authors choose.
<P>
No, QPL isn't my favourite license, but it does serve the
important purpose of allowing the original author(s) the
ability to spin-off closed-source variants.  There's also
nothing to say we can't do a TrollTech later on and go from
QPL to QPL/GPL.
<P>
<B>Tim's Party</b><BR>
Tim from work had his 21st yesterday, and made an open
invition to all the office if people wanted to come.  Most
fun I've had in a group for a long time, the night really
kicked off well.
<P>
We went to a place called the "Glow Bar", which had the most
(or possibly second-most) amazing toilets I had seen --
pretty much everything (the washbasins, the hand-dryer, the
urinal) was a mirror, which certainly made bathroom ettique
interesting.  It's a shame that <a href="/person/rcp/">rcp</a> wasn't
there, I'm sure he would have loved it.
<P>
I left that a somewhat reasonable time, aware of me having
to work the next day.  Kat came to work with a hangover, and
Dan didn't arrive at all.  All up, a fantastic night was had
by all.
<P>
<B>Growing things</b><BR>
Wow, I knew that radishes grew quickly, but I'm still very
impressed by my collection of them.  It's been about a month
and they're already of a quite edible size.
<P>
<B>Melbourne Cup</b><BR>
To some people, it's a horse race.  For myself and many
others, it's a day off work.  Spent the day cycling around
Melbourne -- Merri Creek to Darebin Creek (REALLY pretty in
spots) and then to the Yarra River.  Collected a bunch of
wild garlic that the recent rains had washed up, and got to
meditate on a rock in the middle of the Darebin creek. 
Wonderful day, I'm still feeling good about it.
<P>

            <B>PBMs</b><BR>
Got in contact with Peter Read of Dynamic Games, who really
got me into PBMs and lots of other tactical and strategic
games when I was about 12 years old.  The game that I was
thinking of was called "Warboid World", and no, it's no
longer being run.
<P>
I'm hoping to convince Peter to let me have a stab at
resurrecting Warboid World and some of the other PBM games
that I remember from my youth.  These could hopefully be
re-released as Open Source to be run in a more
Internet-aware enviornment, using an E-mail or web interface
to play the games.  I feel this is much better than the
games dying out completely.

            <B>PBM</b><BR>
Still have this weird desire to play really old PBMs that
don't seem to be around anymore.  I might well take up the
idea of re-coding the one I want to play most from memory in
C++, simply because I know just how long it's been since
I've really done anything in C++ and how rusty my skills in
that area have become.  Perl may be the swiss-army chainsaw
of the Internet, but that doesn't mean I can't get mental
RSI from using it.
<P>
