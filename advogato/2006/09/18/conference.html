    <b>Conference</b><br />
Friday 8th September I gave my <i>Swiss Army Chainsaw</i> presentation at the <a href="http://www.cmga.org.au/">Computer Management Group of Australia</a> conference in Sydney.  This was a challenging task.  My audience worked primarily in mainframe environments, something I have no experience in doing, so I had to be very careful about my assumptions regarding what they may or may not know about Perl.
<p>
Judging from the feedback forwarded to me after the conference, my presentation was very well received.  I was given a 98.2% effectiveness in presentation style, and an indication that I'd be welcome back next year.
<p>
I also have the primary conference organiser learning Perl.  ;)
<p>
<b>Kennedy</b><br />
After the CMGA conference I met up with <a href="http://ali.as/">Adam Kennedy</a>.  Adam was kind enough to travel out to the airport with me so I wouldn't have to worry about missing my flight.  We talked about many things, including just how long it takes to put together a good presentation, and a <i>very</i> large project that Adam's been working upon.  While I'm not at liberty to say more about that project, I can say that Adam has some extremely entertaining stories to tell.  ;)
<p>
<b>Cars</b><br />
In my <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=474&amp;count=1">last journal entry</a> I mentioned how a number of events that were pure luck provided me with a nice financial advantage.  Last Tuesday, the joy that is variance has swung the other way.
<p>
We had loan of Jacinta's parents' car while one of them is interstate.  It's mostly sat in the driveway, since we prefer to use bicycles for transport, but it's been used a few times.  Tuesday was the first day of our <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/courses/programmingperl.html">Programming Perl</a> course in Melbourne.  Since the first day always involves moving a lot of books and course materials, we decided to drive into the city, rather than wrestle with moving it on and off trams, or hiring a taxi.
<p>
Unfortunately, on the way to the course, we had a bit of an accident.  Jacinta performed a head-check at the exact same moment the car in front decelerated.  The whole thing was a testament to modern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crumple_zone">crumple zones</a>, I was completely unharmed, and Jacinta suffered only the most minor of bruises.  In fact, the impact seemed so soft that I expected to see only scratches on the front of the car, not the more extensive damage which occured.
<p>
We're not sure if the car itself can be repaired for a reasonable cost, so we're looking at buying Jacinta's parents a new car.  There are also insurance excess costs, towing costs, and sundry expenses, but they look like they'll be much less than what I had expected.
<p>
Thankfully, none of this will cause us any real financial problems, since we plan for unexpected disasters.
<p>
<b>Freedom</b><br />
Saturday was <a href="http://www.softwarefreedomday.org/">Software Freedom Day</a>, and I helped out by MC'ing at the Melbourne event.  More importantly for me personally, Saturday also marked the start of me having six weeks with <i>no fixed plans</i>.  While there'll be a little bit of paperwork and other minor work in there, most of that's going to
be spent doing whatever I damn well please.  That's going to be a very refreshing change from the last few months of course-writing, paper-writing, and presenting that I have been doing.
<p>
<b>Dead Pixels</b><br />
Today "whatever I damn well please" is unfortunately chasing up warranty claims.  Last night I discovered a cluster of dead pixels on my otherwise outrageously nice laptop display, and today I contacted Dell to see what I can do about having it replaced.
<p>
The laptop itself was imported, since it's <i>much</i> cheaper to buy an American laptop than an Australian one, however Dell has informed me that the warranty on the laptop is only good in the USA.  That's not something I had expected, so after providing a few complimentary words I've asked if they could be so kind as to transfer the warranty, even if that means a small compromise on its duration.
<p>
Ironically, even in the worst case scenario (I pay for an Australian warranty), I can still heartily recommend importing laptops rather than buying them locally.  The cost savings easily covers the warranty cost, so I'm still winning in comparison to a locally purchased unit.
