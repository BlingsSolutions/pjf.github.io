            <p><b>Advertising Overload</b><br/>
Our traditional forms of advertising
<a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a> have been
simple, direct, and relatively cheap.  A few words and special discounts
to usergroups and professional organisations, talking at conferences,
regular networking, referrals from satisfied clients, occasional
appearances in the media, a steady stream of traffic from Google searches.
These are effective, and rarely require any sort of financial commitment
on our behalf.  They've done a pretty good job of getting us clients.
<p>
However recently we've been spending real dollars to expand our
circle of influence.  The sponsorship of
<a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">OSDC</a> isn't because it gives
us a warm feeling by helping an open source conference, it's because
we expect to get bookings from it.  Some developers may have never
heard of <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">PTA</a> before.
Some of them will know about us, but may not have known that
we have a range of courses by Damian Conway open for enrollment.
Entirely different developers may know all that, but have never
actually heard Damian speak, and the conference will give them a
chance to encounter that first hand.  The sponsorship is an investment,
and we're hoping for a good return.
<p>
Today we were contacted by a developer-focused magazine that's
running a feature on training and certification.  They had a full-page
colour advertising space opposite the feature that they desparately needed
to fill due to a last-minute cancellation.  Normally we'd never
even consider taking our a full-page advertisement in this magazine,
the cost would be oppressive, but since they were so eager to have
the spot filled by close-of-business, we negotiated an acceptable deal.
<p>
So not only are we sponsoring a conference, we're running full-page
colour advertisements to 7,100 developers and IT managers, and we're
appearing in a different magazine talking about why Perl can hold
its own against Java, C#/.NET, and C++.  This is just for the
month of December, when we'll also be presenting at
<a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">the conference</a>,
running corporate training courses, and taking
a week off to go diving.  Crickey!

<b>Ascidians</b><br/>
I've been putting some of our <a href="http://pjf.id.au/gallery/castle_rock/">underwater photographs</a> to good use by creating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">wikipedia</a> articles on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Tulip">Sea Tulips</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_ascidian">Solitary Ascidians</a>.  Both rather rather strange looking sessile filter-feeders, but apparently they're reasonably closely related to each other.  To make them extra strange, they use vanadium in the transportation of oxygen.

            <p><b>Ghostbusters</b><br/>
One of the television stations is running a <i>20 year anniversary</i> special of Ghostbusters (and Ghostbusters II).  Boy, I sure feel old now.  When I was a child I built my own ghostbusting paraphernalia -- we'd catch ghosts using equipment cobbled together from an old vacuum cleaner, turntable, and pram.  An evaporative cooling unit was used for containment.
<p>
We must have done a pretty good job, as I haven't heard of <i>any</i> ghosts hanging around my old suburb since that time.

<b>Tax</b><br/>
Spent the day working on tax matters.  This wasn't anywhere as exciting as it
may seem, and I'm sure most people don't consider tax to be even remotely
enchanting.  Most of the work was spent ensuring that all the accounts were
reconciled for last quarter, and the primary source of frustration was
caused by some misplaced invoices.  It would appear that I had started two
indepdent folders for the invoices in question, and had filed the older
invoices into a section which I had since forgotten.
<p>
The most amusing part of dealing with tax matters was to discover that
the <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au/">Australian Tax Office</a> had given
me the option of making GST installments.  This means no <i>mandatory</i>
pain of ensuring accounts are reconciled at the end of each quarter,
and a generous period of time at the end of the financial year to
make sure that everything is accounted for.  The installments are also
well less than the tax we would otherwise have to remit, so the business
gains a slight gain from interest earned on this money.
<p>
Tomorrow will be spent double-checking what is likely to be the most
complex personal tax return I'll ever complete.  Thankfully it's all
filled out, and I only need to recheck the figures.
<p>
<b>Travel and Training</b><br/>
I'm flying up to Sydney next week to teach four days worth of
<a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training</a>.  Sydney courses
are always a bit of a gamble, but we've got a good attendence for our
public courses, and a new facilities vendor who is offering lower prices,
better food, and more importantly <i>more drinkable coffee</i> than
our old suppliers.
<p>
While I love teaching, I don't enjoy the travel, and living away from
home for another whole week isn't particularly appealing.  Jacinta's
clearly looking forward to my return as well, since with me away she'll
be responsible for letting the chickens out at 5am each morning.
<p>
<b>Syndicated Blogs</b><br/>
I've got <a href="http://pjf.id.au/">pjf.id.au</a> now producing an
<a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/index.rss">RSS feed</a> of my journal.
This is nothing short of pure narcissism, and rather pointless
narcissism at that, since I'll have no chance to write in my journal
while I'm away interstate.  Nevertheless, it's done.  There's even
a link on the <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/">journal navigation</a>
to add it as a Mozilla sidebar tab.
<p>
<b>Training Calendar</b><br/>
<a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a>
has just finished determining its
<a href="http://perltraining.com.au/calendar.html">public training calendar</a>
for 2005.  We're still finalising a few details near the end of the
year, but it looks like I'll be keeping out of trouble for some time.
Included is a <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/webdev.html">new course</a>
on web development, which will be focusing on using HTML::Mason,
along with plenty of practical exercises.
<p>
Our (obviously private) calendar of corporate bookings is also filling
up, with banks and government being the most active seekers of training
at this time.
