<b>Childhood dream fulfilled</b><br/>
Like many other eight year olds, I was caught up in the <i>Ghostbusters</i>
craze some twenty years ago.  I watched the movie so often I knew most
of the script.  As a fledgling roleplayer I had the Ghostbusters RPG.
As an imaginative child I would procure many household items (vacuum
cleaners, turntables, radios, hairdryers) for conversion into
ghostbusting equipment, which (much to my parents chagrin) usually
involved them being disassembled and the electronics coated in cooking
oil to shield against ghosts.
<p>
I also had the Ghostbusters computer game, for the Commodore 64.
It was a good game for its era, although its primary selling points
were the song lyrics on the title screen, and two voice-synthesized
phrases: <i>Ghostbusters!</i> and <i>It slimed me!</i>.
<p>
Despite hours of play of the Ghostbusters computer game, I never
managed to complete it.  The last scene involved sneaking two
ghostbusters past the marshmallow man, and I could only ever get a
single one past.  I had heard tales of friends of friends who had
done it, but nobody I had actually met in the flesh.
<p>
Yesterday, on a whim, I grabbed a copy of Ghostbusters for my
emulator and tried my luck again.  As fate would have it, I got
past the marshmallow man on the very first game, with the very
first two ghostbusters.  My childhood dream was fulfilled.
<p>
Unfortunately, like many games of its era, the end-scene for
the Ghostbusters C-64 game was rather uninspiring.  A brief
and unexciting animation, followed by some written text which
amounts to a little more than <i>Congratulations, you have won</i>.
Regardless of the poor ending, I still feel superior over my peers
for having seen it.
<p>
<b>Breakfast dreams shattered</b><br/>
Awoke rather early today in preparation for a long trip across town
to visit an irregular client.  With some excitement I realised that
I woke early enough to allow me to comfortably make my favourite
breakfast: soft-boiled eggs with soldiers and espresso coffee.
<p>
Unfortunately, we were out of bread, so this dream never came to
fruition.  In hindsight I probably could have walked to the corner
store and picked up some bread rather than writing a journal entry
about things I thought were cool when I was eight, and what I was
planning to have for breakfast.

<b>Photos of The Damian</b><br/>
As part of our
<a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia's</a>
advertising campaign we're looking at adding pictures of our trainers
to both the website and a number of our advertising materials.  Since
we have a number of courses to be conducted by Dr Damian Conway early
next year (<a href="http://perltraining.com.au/bookings.html">bookings are
open</a>), Jacinta politely asked Damian for an appropriate photo.  To
quote from the e-mail that ensued:

<b>Awake too early</b><br/>
I woke up this morning before most of the cron jobs on the servers
I maintain.  That's much too early for my liking.  I've had a busy
week, and a busy day and weekend ahead.  Unfortunately that leaves
me with little time to write in my journal.
<p>
At least the training centre where I'm teaching today has half-decent
coffee.
<p>
On an unrelated topic, there's now a
<a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/toc.html">Table of Contents</a> of all
my journal entries, which extends way back before I started using
the system on <a href="http://use.perl.org/">use.perl</a>.

<b>Just looking at the advertisements</b><br/>
Normally when people purchase a magazine, they do so for the content.  Ads usually get glanced at, and sometimes will invoke a reaction from the reader, but they're rarely the reason to purchase the magazine in the first place.
<p>
Yesterday I was working with Jacinta on an advertisement for <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a>.  Neither of us are marketing geeks or have great graphical design skills, so we decided to see how other people advertise.  We went through a number of magazines that we had received recently, and just looked at the ads.
<p>
It was only afterwards that we realised that despite spending considerable time examining those magazines, neithre of us had actually read any real content.  <i>"That was a magazine on business banking?  Are the articles any good?"; "I don't know.  I didn't read them either."</i>
<p>
I believe that our final, full-page, colour advertisement looks acceptably swish.  It will be appearing in next month's <i>Builder</i> magazine.
<p>
<b>Lemonade III</b><br/>
In order to use the (literally) buckets of lemons that are dropping from our tree, we've started <a href="http://pjf.id.au/brew/brews/11_lemonade.html">Lemonade III</a>.  We've learnt from our earlier attempts, and expect the final product to be quite drinkable.
<p>
Unfortunately, the yeast seems to be having trouble starting.  We're using a champagne yeast, and it may be having problems with the pH of the solution, which is quite acidic with all that lemon juice.  We've given it a kick today (a cup of warm active yeast and sugar), but if it still doesn't take after a few days we may need to change yeasts entirely.
