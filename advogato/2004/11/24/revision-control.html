    <b>Revision Control</b><br>
Goodness, sponsoring a conference is an awful lot of work.  There's
brochures to print, presentation folders to make, advertisements to
prepare to particular dimensons, speaking opportunities, and an awful
lot of text to write for everything.  On top of that add the regular
conference things like your own presentations, and stir in a number of
clients trying to spend their budgets before the end of the year, and
you end up with a particularly busy week.  There's a good chance that
something can be overlooked.
<p>
As developers and writers we all know the golden rule of working
together, or even just singularly.  Revision control, revision
control, revision control; and in my case a little coffee on the
side.  However during this hectic week of presentations, a mistake
was made.  I broke the golden rule.  When submitting one of our
advertisements, I submitted the wrong one.
<p>
Sure, there was a 30-minute deadline to get the advertisement to
the relevant people, and sure there was a conversion process in there
to get it into the preferred format, and yes this was at the end of
the day with other deadlines looming.  It's the perfect situation for
a mistake to be made, and that's why the golden rule of revision
control is all the more important.
<p>
In this particular case, I didn't know that the document had been
filed into CVS.  I knew that it <i>should</i> have been.  Jacinta knew
that too, and indeed had placed it into CVS into the most obvious
location, and updated it to the revised version that we actually
wanted to use.  Everything was there, I just didn't bother to type
<tt>cvs update</tt> to find out.
<p>

<p> Remember this kids -- revision control is important.  Don't snigger
when Grandpa uses subversion to record his shopping list, you
will too someday.  Why, back in my day we didn't even have
subversion...
<p>
As it was, the old document we submitted was perfectly good, it just
wasn't as good as the newer version.
<p>
<b>Wikipedia and chickens</b><br>
I've discovered that wikipedia, while having a very large
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chicken_breeds">list of
chicken breeds</a>, has very little information on most, and no
good index on which breeds are actually documented.  As such, I spent
a little time putting toegether a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Chicken_breeds">chicken
breeds</a> category, showing the breeds that contain at least some
level of documentation.  Unfortunately, there's not very many at all.
