            <p><b>Linux.conf.au, Day 1</b><br />
I've got a number of journal entries prepared to continue the report on my dive adventures, but I haven't finished of the processing of the photographs to go with them.  They'll be posted when I have a spare moment.
<p>
I've arrived in Sydney for <a href="http://linux.conf.au/">Linux.conf.au</a>, which is huge, and allegedly has 700-800 attendees.  Every session I've been to, including the keynote/welcome, has been packed, with numerous people standing or sitting on the floor.
<p>
The regular conference-goers are here, as well as Nat Torkington, whom I didn't expect.  I also shared a mini-bus from the airport with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Tanenbaum">Andrew Tanenbaum</a>.
<p>
I'm planning to spend much of the day in the hallway stream, although I'm attending a few of the presentations here and there.  I'm also posting what few photographs I take to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pfenwick/">flickr</a>.  I daresay that I'm both a poor photographer and a flickr newbie, so don't expect anything too amazing.
<p>
Tonight is the <i>speakers' dinner</i>, which is on a boat.  Tomorrow night is a party which I believe is sponsored by Google, Wednesday is the professional delegates and speakers' "networking session" (booze-up), and Friday night is the conference dinner.  I'm planning to sleep Thursday night in order to be awake before 6am for the "speakers' adventure".

            <p><b>Away diving - Day 0</b><br />
Today (Tuesday 2nd January) we left for our big dive trip, and discovered that
sometimes just getting places can be a little too exciting.
It started with a late taxi (that's fine, we plan for such
things), a huge queue at the airport (still okay...), our
airline telling us that they'd overbooked the flight(!),
and a free upgrade to Business Class for Jacinta.  So far,
so good.
<p>
Where things started to get exciting is that our flight to
Brisbane was running late, and it connects with a second
flight to Bundaberg where our boat leaves.  At this time
we discovered two notable facts: 1) even though we're booked
for a connecting flight, there's no guarantee it will actually
connect; and 2) the flight we're trying to connect with is the
last one for that day.
<p>
Since our dive boat would be departing that evening, and
would not return until a week later, we were rather concerned
that our holiday wouldn't even start!  Important lesson
learned: when booking connecting flights, make sure you're not
connecting to the last one.
<p>
After some worried phone-calls and significant time spent
ingratiating myself with as many flight staff as possible,
we were informed that the plane would be held for us, and
we could all breathe easy.  So we got to the boat with plenty
of time to spare (the last flight still arrived many hours
before the boat departed).
<p>
On the boat, we were told that the trip to our first dive
site overnight would be rough, and indeed it was!  I was
prepared with sea-sickness medication, and was surprised
that it did nothing whatsoever to help.  I spent most of
the early hours of the morning "feeding the fishes", as
the local saying goes.  Important lesson learned: bring
<i>really strong</i> sea-sickness medication for the
first night.  Luckily, I've had not even a hint of
sea-sickness since then.
<p><b>Day 1</b><br/>
We had five dives today, from early-morning to night.  We've
seen some pretty cool things, the most notable being a
huge olive sea-snake searching for food, and about four
turtles that were bigger than me (as well as many smaller
ones).
<p>
The down-point of today was that our back-up torches flooded
during the night-dive, and are certainly not in any condition
to be taken underwater again.  Instead of them failing in
the obvious way (a bad o-ring seal), they failed at the
<i>switches</i>, which are not even mentioned in the maintenance
manual.
<p>
The real failure with our torches was our own; as every good
sys-admin knows, you should always test your back-ups.  Dropping
our secondary lights in a bucket of fresh water would likely have
revealed bubbles, and alerted us to a problem with minimal damage to
electronics.  Important lesson learned: even when you're on
holidays, you're still a sys-admin.
<p>
The high-point was seeing a beautiful olive sea snake, a thick
as my leg, and twice as long!  It was extremely active, searching
for food in all the coral nooks and crannies.  It also seemed to
be completely unworried to have a couple of divers watching it.
Unfortunately our camera batteries were flat, so no photographs.

            <p><b>OSDC Wind-up</b><br />
It's been a week since OSDC finished, so I thought it best I tie up a few loose ends.  On Sunday Jacinta and I took Randal and Cog to the <a href="http://www.melbourneaquarium.com.au/">Melbourne Aquarium</a>.  This was very well received; it seems that our unique aquatic life are just as interesting as our land species.
<p>
In addition to the aquarium, books were autographed, gifts exchanged, drinks consumed, and stories were told.  Unfortunately were weren't able to find any pajamas with kangraroos on them; cog was looking for them "for a friend". ;)
<p>
Thanks to Jacinta's hard work, a <a href="http://perl.net.au/wiki/Open_Source_Developers_Conference_2006">summary of the conference</a>, including a <a href="http://perl.net.au/wiki/Open_Source_Developers_Conference_2006#Blogs">list of blogs</a> is on <a href="http://perl.net.au/">PerlNet</a>.  Please feel free to add to the list, you don't need an account to make changes.

            <p><b>What's new in Perl 5.10</b><br />
The slides from my talk are now available at the <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/talks/">Perl Training Australia talks page</a>, and can be modified and distributed under the terms of Perl itself (see the license at the end of the presentation).
<p>
<p><b>OSDC, day 3 + aftermath</b><br />
For a good description of talks and events, see <a href="http://use.perl.org/~cog/journal/">cog's journal</a>.
<p>
Day 3 of OSDC involved me giving my talk on <i>Human Interfaces for Geeks</i> which was extremely well received, especially if the number of drinks purchased for me at the pub are anything to go by.  Thank-you, everyone.
<p>
An especially big thank-you goes to Jarkko Hietaniemi, who patched <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Acme::Ook">Acme::Ook</a> with less than 24 hours notice to assist me in writing a lightning talk.  The result was <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Acme::OSDc">Acme::OSDc</a>,  a module to compile and run a language presented by Jon Oxer (of Linux Australia fame) in the lightning talks the day before.
<p>
In true OSDC fashion, the entire module was written "live" on-stage in less than 5 minutes.
<p>
After the conference we went to a pub, and then another pub, and then a bar...  You probably get the idea.  Currently Randal and cog are visiting <a href="http://www.zoo.org.au/visiting.cfm?zoo_id=2">Healesville</a> with Scott and Amanda, and I'm sure are having a great time.   However with 37'C temperatures (98.6'F) I imagine they'll be spending a lot of time in the shade.

            <p><b>OSDC Day 2</b><br />
I missed the first half the day, as I had stayed up very
late the night before and slept in.  It seems <a
href="http://use.perl.org/~cog/journal/31833">I wasn't the
only one</a> who wanted an extra snooze.
<p>
I spent most of the day in the <i>Hallway Track</i>,
speaking with people and catching up on events.  A notable
exception was the lightning talks, which are always worth
seeing at OSDC.  <a href="http://jose-castro.org/">Jos&eacute;</a>
encouraged everyone to start <a
href="http://use.perl.org/">use.perl</a> journals as a way
to attract more international speakers, and singled me out
as an example.  Whether I'm a  good example or a bad one, I
don't quite know.
<p>
I'm presently working on my talks for tomorrow, including
both a lightning talk and my main presentation.  I've also
discovered I need to think more about my talk titles for
multi-track conferences.  A title like <a
href="http://osdc2006.cgpublisher.com/proposals/56/index_html">Human
Interfaces for Geeks</a> works great for a single-stream,
but I feel isn't catchy enough to attract the crowd I'd like
when competing with multiple streams.  Next year I'll have
to use a title like <i>Robotic Ninja Pirates</i>.
