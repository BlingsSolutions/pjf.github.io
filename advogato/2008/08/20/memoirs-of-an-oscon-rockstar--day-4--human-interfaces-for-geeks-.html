    <p><b>Memoirs of an OSCON rockstar, Day 4 (Human Interfaces for Geeks)</b><br>
My sleeping pattern at OSCON remains sub-optimal.  I've crossed
timezones, and beause there are so many cool tings to do each
evening, <i>and</i> talk practicing and preparation, I find
myself going to bed late and sleeping in.  I <i>could</i>
push myself to wake up early, but being sleepy really wrecks
my speaking ability, and after my talk on failure, I've got
a reputation to maintain.
<p>
I wake up late in the morning, and receive what was the most exicting
e-mail I'd received in the entire conference.  It's from Allison
Randal:
<blockquote>
<i>Would you be willing to repeat "An Illustrated History of Failure"
[as a plenary]? It'd be 12:45pm Friday. </i>
</blockquote>
<p>
Woah!
<p>
At this point I should mention that presenting a plenary/keynote at
OSCON is one of my lifetime goals.  I thought that I'd gain a little
fame at 2008, a somewhat bigger audience in 2009, and then if I'm very
very lucky I could possibly be considered for a plenary/keynote in
2010.  I certainly didn't expect it at my first OSCON!  The only
lifetime goal I thought I would have had a chance of claiming at
OSCON was to play <a href="http://www.rockband.com/">Rock Band</a>.
<p>
Today I'm presenting "Human Interfaces for Geeks", aka "Hacking
Wetware for Fun and Profit", aka "Paul can't make up his mind
as to what this talk should be called".  My talk is essentially
about how people think, how to make them happy, and how
<i>making them happy causes them to do your bidding</i>.
<p>
When possible, I try to include conference-specific jokes in my
talks.  In my failure talk I managed to reference Rod::Logic and
Dr. Evil Conway.  Here, I figured that enough of my audience would
have gone to <i>People for Geeks</i>, so last night I had picked
Schwern as my victim.  Schwern had kindly provided me with some
pictures of him as a zombie, and I spent <i>way</i> too long last night creating
Schwern in The Sims 2, taking screenshots, turning him into a zombie,
and adding general zombie references.
<p>
I arrive at OSCON in time for lunch, rather sad that I've missed
some of the morning talks I was really looking forward to.  I'm also
stuck for where I should go after lunch; Anthony Baxter's running
the general lightning talks, and I <i>love</i> lightning talks.
Anthony runs the lightning talks at OSDC, and Linux.conf.au, and he
does a great job of keeping things moving and amusing.  I've got
stacks of lightning talks up my sleeve, so attending this should
have been a no-brainer.
<p>
However, Tim Bunce of DBI fame is giving a talk on
<i>Ultimate Perl Code Profiling</i>.  I'd spoken briefly to Tim
earlier in the week, and he told me new the profiler is awesomely
cool.  I know that I <i>could</i> learn it in my own time, but that
will probably take months before I get a round tuit, or I could just
attend Tim's talk and download it into my head in one go.
<p>
I attend Tim's talk.  It is awesome.  I know kung-fu.
<p>
I sneak out of Tim's talk during question time, because my
talk is next.  I find coffee and hurry to the room where I'm
presenting.
<p>
Amazingly, the talk goes down <i>extermely</i> well.  I seem to have
been gaining popularity over the conference, and now not only is the
room stuffed with people, but there's even a handheld video camera in
the audience!  It seems the audience wasn't disappointed, giving me
a 4.9/5.0 across 16 ratings!  Wow.
<p>
Next up are the Perl Lightning Talks.  I wasn't sure what to expect
from these, as I've seen lightning talks done really bad, but these
are just superb!  The Perl community has some great speakers, and
the talks are witty, informative, and well presented.  Of course, I
give one on <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/tips/2008-08-20.html">autodie</a>, in case the conference hasn't heard enough
about it already.  ;)
<p>
The conference ends with Larry's "State of the Onion", and the Perl
Foundation Auction.  Unfortunately things run a little late, and
we lose a few too many audience members before the auction.  I pick
up a copy of Perl Medic (autographed, yay!), a few assorted other books,
and some cool YAPC drinking glasses.
<p>
With the main conference over, I head off to a rather exclusive
OSCON after-party.  Everyone at the party is famous.  <i>Everyone.</i> In fact,
as r0ml casually comments to me that his son wrote Twisted (python),
I realise that everyone <i>and their families</i> are famous.
<p>
The party was amazing, although I continue to make the odd faux pas:
"Oh, you use <a href="http://identi.ca/pjf/">identi.ca</a> too?", "No, I'm <a href="http://identi.ca/evan/">@evan</a>.  I <i>wrote</i> identi.ca."
Eventually I get used to the idea that if someone mentions a technology
I use, then not only did they write said technology, but they also
hold a Nobel Prize, played a role in the original Star Wars, and
psychically know what I want to drink next.
<p>
Eventually the party gets broken up.  It's probably the first time I've
ever been to a party so cool that it gets broken up rather than just peters out.  I head back to my hotel, discover I'm hungry, and go looking for food at 3am.  I find a Mexican place that gives me the most awesome burrito I've ever had in my life, but since I can't for the life of me remember what it was called, when I return there the next day I'm served something which is considerably less than awesome.
<p>
Eventually I get back to the hotel, set multiple alarms so I don't miss my talking slot, and sleep.
