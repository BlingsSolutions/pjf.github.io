    <p><b>Memoirs of an OSCON rockstar, Day 1 (Perl Security)</b><br>
I wake up and go to Damian Conway's tutorial on programming vim.
After a mere 10 minutes I've already learnt a huge bundle of
new tricks, and have additioanl goodies added to my .vimrc
file.  After 30 minutes I realise that I can't stay.  I'm
tired, and I can't stop thinking about the tutorial I'm
giving in the afternoon.  With great reluctance I excuse
myself, head to the Speakers' Lounge, ingest coffee, and hack
on slides.
<p>
At this point the Speakers' Lounge may as well be called the
Aussie Lounge.  There's Adam Kennedy, Pia Waugh, Laura Thompson, 
Luke Welling, Anthony Baxter and Stewart Smith all there.  Jokes
are made about 'OZCON'.
<p>
I keep encountering new people at the Speakers' Lounge.  They're
all famous, but I have to work on my slides.  Three hours is a
<i>lot</i> of presenting, and I'm really trying to make a good
impression.  It's my first time at OSCON, and my first time in front
of an American audience.
<p>
When I present my tutorial, I find my audience is <i>huge</i>.
I've got 80-100 people!  My presentation ends up being "okay",
even though I'm handing out chocolates for anyone who asks a
good question, or comes up with a good answer.  I'm not happy
with my pace (too quick), and fear some of my topics may
have not fully sunk home with my audience.
<p>
The 3 hour tutorial format is <i>hard</i>.  People naturally
get learning fatigue, particularly if they're doing theory
for a long time without doing practical exercises, or getting up
for a break.  That's why lectures at University are usually
an hour or less, because that's about as long as you feed an
audience theory before it stops being absorbed.
<p>
One thing I misjudged is how many questions I'd receive.  I figured
going to OSCON I'm going to have an entire contingent of extremely
smart, extremely vocal, high-profile hecklers who'll quiz me
on difficult topics.  This never happened; I don't know if it's
because my audience was polite, or because my hecklers didn't
arrive; I suspect it's a combination of both.
<p>
Despite the fact that I really thought my tutorial was luke-warm, I
found that throughout the week I have plenty of people actively
seeking me out and telling me how much they enjoyed the talk.
Thank-goodness for the +2 aussie bonus.  For those who are curious,
I received a 4.55 average rating across 40 evaluations, which isn't
too shabby at all.
<p>
In the evening I went to have sushi with the Moose and Best Practical
crowd.  From there, back to the hotel, where Andy Lester catches me
and asks if I want to meet at the DoubleTree hotel to help him work
on his tutorial the next day.  Apparently there'll be beer, and
since I'm exhausted from my tutorial, I figure I could <i>really</i> do
with a beer.
<p>
When I arrive at the DoubleTree, I find there's a big contingent
of drinking Australians, along with a decent number of Python people,
who, as usual, are all famous.  I join the table, swap stories,
admire tattoos, and discuss various topics.  Andy arrives, but proclaims
that he won't be upset at all if I finish another beer or two, so
I don't actually help him with slides at all.  Oops!
<p>
Eventually, I head back to the hotel knowing that I have the rare luxury of not giving a presentation the next day, and can relax a little.
