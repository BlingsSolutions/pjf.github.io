            <p><b>autodie 1.999_01 (beta) released</b><br>
Today I decided to hack code while sitting under a tree, along the beautiful banks of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merri_Creek">Merri Creek</a>.  I promised myself that I'd make a dev release of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?autodie">autodie</a> before I finished for the day.  Since I had forgotten to bring a cushion, autodie 1.999_01 will be remembered as my first release made due to me having an overly sore butt.
<p>
The new version of autodie is a <i>dev release</i>, which in any other language means "beta".  It won't get installed by default with the CPAN installer, but you can <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~pjf/autodie-1.999_01/">download it manually</a> and play with it.  The <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2009/04/msg145908.html">hinting interface</a> is there, and while it may have a few rough corners, it's pretty much all working.
<p>
To release autodie 2.0, I need to walk through the source and tidy up a number of TODOs (there are <i>lots</i> of these), check the documentation is correct (the hinting interface has changed a little since the docs were written), and add a few more test cases.  Patches are welcome for any of these, and best made via <a href="https://github.com/pfenwick/autodie/">github</a> (fork the repo and check out the hints branch), although any form of patch is welcome.

            <p><b>Perl for Geoscience</b><br>
Traditionally our <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl courses</a> have been targeted at people who work with computers as a job.  Developers, software QA, sysadmins, database admins (DBAs), and the like.  However, recently I've noticed a sharp increase in course bookings from people who <i>don't</i> have computers as their primary job.  In particular, we've been seeing a lot of bookings from people who work in geoscience, and hydrology in particular.  These bookings aren't just from within Australia, I'm seeing international interest as well.
<p>
It seems that Perl has gained a reputation as being a good cross-platform language for when you have a big hunk of data in one format, and you need to get that data into another format.  Geoscience folks deal with lots of data, and they seem to be perpetually massaging it (often by hand, or in a spreadsheet) to get it into the format they need.
<p>
Perl is certainly well-suited for this task, and people learning Perl for the purposes of data transformation have been a mainstay on our courses since we first started running them.  However I've found our new wave of interest particularly challenging to teach.  They don't have any programming backgrounds, so I can't draw analogies to other languages, or even assume they'd know why subroutines are a good idea.  They may have never used a command-line before, so the concept of providing command-line arguments is completely foreign.  Even the way they think about data is different; for many students in my last class, the idea of hierarchical data (such as a tree) was a completely new concept; in their world, data had always been tabular in nature.
<p>
I'm thrilled that I'm able to teach people new skills, and I'm sure some of the students from my classes will be going back to their workplaces and replacing some of their colleagues with very small Perl scripts.  However I'm deeply worried that their understanding will be too incomplete.  I teach a very <i>modern</i> Perl course, with a lot of focus on best practices, maintainability, validation, and theory.  While I know some of my students can grasp this a little, others are still struggling with consistent indentation, and can't grok the long-term concepts at all.  I fear they'll under-use the CPAN, reinvent the wheel, copy-and-paste from bad examples, fail to use revision control, fail to document their code, pile on technical debt, and do all the other things that inexperienced programmers do.
<p>
I don't know what to do about this.  For this group of people, I think I'd get great feedback (and more bookings and money!) if I taught a class that focused on short-cuts and quick'n'dirty programming, since my students can grasp those short-term gains; they can't as easily grasp the long-term ones of maintainability, testing, source control, and correctness.  One could argue those long-term goals aren't important for my new clients, since they're writing code for "once-off" tasks, but as most of us know, there's an awful lot of <i>once-off</i> code that's still being used decades after it was written.  I feel the concepts of code quality and maintainability are <i>more</i> important for inexperienced programmers than anyone else, since they're the ones most likely to make these mistakes.  I'd rather not teach at all than teach bad practices.
<p>
I think we'll probably extend our most popular course to five days, and slow down the material; I've got enough cool bonus material to fill an extra day if we have a class of more computer-oriented students.  I've also found myself dropping entirely some of the more foreign concepts like pipes, buffering, file locking, and running external commands; students can look these up if they ever need them.
<p>
What I <i>really</i> wish I could do is sit down with my new classes for a week and teach them basic programming and computer science concepts, <a href="http://www.csunplugged.com/">preferably without computers getting involved at all</a>.

            <p><b>The social life of a Perl trainer</b><br>
I'm blogging every week about Perl, not least due to the presence of
a <a href="http://www.enlightenedperl.org/ironman.html">competition</a> that encourages me to do so.  However this week I'm not
dealing with technical matters, I'm dealing with personal and social ones.
<p>
There's a common perception that I have a massively social job.  I
travel around the world and teach people Perl.  I speak at many conferences
each year.  I attend a multitude of user-groups.  Sometimes I do consulting, and
when I do, the things I'm fixing are often people related: internal education,
politics, and culture.  In any given year I meet work closely with <i>hundreds</i> of new people.  People are my life and my job.
<p>
Despite that, sometimes it feels very lonely.
<p>
The problem isn't with the quantity of people I meet, but the quality of
my relationships with them.  When I meet course attendees we spend a lot
of time together, but it's one-to-many time.  At conferences I have
more quality social time, but it's only for a couple of days, and my
talk preparations often get in the way.  Often there are <i>so
many</i> people at conferences I want to meet or catch up with that I
only spend at most a few hours with each person, regardless of how
much I like them.
<p>
Due to my lifestyle, I meet many wonderful people who I would <i>love</i> to spend more time with.  The problem is that so many of them live in other cities, or other countries, or have travelling or lifestyle schedules similar to me.  In fact, my travel schedule can really screw things up.  Last night there was a gathering of four of my most favourite people in the whole world, and in my home town.  I wasn't there, because I was on an yet another airplane.
<p>
Back when I had a "real job", or even when I did regular consulting, I didn't
have these problems.  I'd see the same people each week at work.  I'd go
to the same places for lunch.  There'd be regular social activities
that I could attend, because I wasn't changing city every week.  While
having a regular job may not help with the breadth of friendships, it
certainly helps with the depth of them.
<p>
I've been teaching and living this lifestyle for many years, so why am
I noticing this just now?  Well, it's partially because I'm so busy
right now.  The global financial crisis has kicked our business into
overdrive.  A combination of hiring-freezes, and the need to do more
with less, has caused Perl courses and consulting to be very popular.  Sometimes I joke about being in a different city every week, but recently it's been the norm.
<p>
However the big wake-up was that how I've been associating with my students
has changed.  Years ago they were learning Perl because it was cool, and
fun, and because doing things in Perl was so much easier than doing things
in almost any other language.  Those students were were bright, eager to learn,
and full of questions.  That almost always meant that I got along extremely well with them socially, as well as academically.  These days we still get those
students, but many people are on our courses because programming is their job,
not their passion.  They don't always self-identify as geeks, and I find that I have an awkward time relating to them socially.
<p>
Having good students is one of the most rewarding parts of being a teacher,
and is what got me hooked on teaching before I even graduated from
University.  I'm unlikely to give up the teaching any time soon; I enjoy
the travel, the freedom, and it's certainly hard to argue with the money, but I do find that ephemeral socialisation is really starting to tick me off.
Sometimes I wonder if I should actually go back and teach at University,
purely for the social highs associated with doing so.

            <p><b>autodie status update</b><br>
I just looked through my blog history, and discovered the last release of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?autodie">autodie</a>, I've blogged about was version 1.99!  Since then, there's been nine releases!  For those of you new to my blog, autodie is a lexical pragma that allows Perl's built-ins to throw exceptions on failure, which can take your error-handling from cumbersome to simple.
<p>
There's been a lot of changes in those nine releases, and the <a href="http://github.com/pfenwick/autodie/tree/master/Changes">Changes</a> file documents all the significant ones.  There are nicer error messages, better coverage of Perl's core functions, fewer rough edges, and lots more tests.  If you're not one to go reading Changes files, I can assure you that upgrading to 1.999 is pleasant and surprise-free.
<p>
I've had a few people tease me about the silly version number, 1.999 threatens to have 1.9991 as a next release, but this will not happen.  The next version of autodie will be 2.000, and this actually represents a significant change.  There's no backwardly incompatible changes, but there is a new feature which greatly extends autodie's ability to detect failures in non-core subroutines.
<p>
Presently, one can write:
