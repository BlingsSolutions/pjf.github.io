            <B>Health</b><BR>
I'm feeling <I>much</i> better now (compared to the previous
few days).  As such I spent a day at work and even wrote
useful code.  This is much better than what happened on
Tuesday, where I spent most of the day in a zombie state.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
It's out there, and I've told people about it.  I've made a
file release on <A
HREF=http://www.sourceforge.net/>SourceForge</a>, submitted
details to <A HREF=http://www.freshmeat.net/>Freshmeat</a>,
and will be releasing on CPAN shortly.  With luck I'll get a
number of comments, bug reports, and desired features back. 
Possibly a few flames as well.
<P>
<B>Ian</b><BR>
Ian's really getting into the whole
SysAdmins-with-weapons-thing.  I think this was something
that he was never allowed to do at DECR because of the
students, and at his conslutancy job because of the
customers.  Hopefully his aim will get better in time.  He
doesn't scare me at all yet.
<P>
<B>Ian/Rockclimbing</b><BR>
Ian wants me to go rockclimbing with him tonight.  I want to
go too, but I'm very aware of how little awareness I have of
my surroundings with this virus on me.  I don't want to risk
me being dangerous to either Ian or myself.

Hah!  It's easy to make money from Open Source.  With the
help of GnuCash I've discovered better decisions I can make
with some tricky financial choices that are just around the
bend.  This will save me quite a bit of money.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
<A
HREF=https://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=4232>Finance::Quote</a>
is now available on Sourceforge.  Hooray.  The code in the
CVS tree works pretty well, and I hope to have a proper
packagey thing out shortly for CPAN...  When I'm feeling
better.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Went to work today because I'm feeling much much better than
I was over the weekend.  Many people used colourful
expressions to describe
how I looked, and a number have encouraged me to go home
early and get some rest.  That sounds like a pretty good
idea.
<P>
Ian's at work now, with new cute little glasses. 
Unfortunately I wasn't feeling well enough to give him a
proper welcome to the company (nerf guns, whipped cream and
bondage), so he's managed to escape his first few days here
with some scraps of dignity.  I'm sure I'll be able to fix
that in time.

            <B>Dinner</b><BR>
Went to dinner with my parents last night at a nearby
Turkish resturant.  I've been to this resturant many times
before and enjoyed both their food and service, but last
thing things were oddly different.
<P>
Upon entering the resturant, a bearded man, in his 40s or
50s, approached me.  "<I>Excuse me, but are you Mozart?</i>"
he queried with a rich European accent.  The man took it
well when I confessed that I was not Mozart, and he went
back to ordering from the take-away bar.  It never occured
to me before that I may look like a great composer, although
my uncle has been asked many times if he was John Lennon.
<P>
My parents, Jacinta, and myself sat at a table in the
corner.  We talked a little about the menu when I heard
someone calling my name.  "<I>Excuse me?  Paul?</i>"  An old
collegue of mine from my Computer Science days was sitting
on the table next to me.  "<I>Didn't you just submit a
couple of patches to GnuCash?</i>"  Oh dear, my toying with
accounting programs is starting to have influences on the
real world.  Should I be worried?

            <B>General thoughts</b><BR>
I fear that my recent illness and interest in financial
material is not from natural causes, and may be related to
my recent abduction.
<P>
At first I thought the distorted sound, bright lights,
ghostly voices, and the distinct impression of an anal probe
were merely the side effects of eating extra-hot curry after
a few too many beers.  After some careful reflection I feel
that I cannot dismiss this incident out-of-hand, no matter
how normal and trivial it may seem to be.
<P>
My only vivid memories were that of <I>things</i> that were
humanoid in shape.  I distinctly remember one of them having
a beard, but did not catch sight of the rest of its face. 
They were wearing white lab-coats, did not speak, and
appeared to be drinking instant coffee.  I remember trying
-- without success -- to convince one of these creatures
that the ground coffee was much better, even if it took
longer to brew.
<P>
My next memory is that of waking the next morning with a
blocked nose and a strange desire to read <I>TaxPack
98-99</i>.  I suspect that I may be suffering from the
effects of mind-control, mood-altering drugs, or even DNA
manipulation transmitted through a virus vector.
<P>
The virus-vectored genetic manipulation scenario is
unlikely, but must not be ignored.  While I believe that I
am no longer contagious, I may have unwittingly affected
others with my illness.  This could prove disasterous, and
could cost the <A HREF=http://www.ato.gov.au>Australian
Taxation Office</a> hundreds of dollars in claims that
replacement nerf-darts and mini-pumpkins are work related
expenses.
<P>
I am investing in an <A
HREF=http://members.tripod.com/~zoam/afdb.html>Aluminium
Foil Deflector Beanie</a> to guard against mind-control, and
sipping lemon-and-honey to combat the mood-altering drugs
and sore throat.
<P>
<B>Work/GnuCash/Quote.pm</b><BR>
Nothing to report as my illness is adversely altering my
mental capacity to write code.  Will be spending the day in
bed.  <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/dancer>Dancer</a> was
kind enough to send me a get-well e-mail.  I'm glad to see
that my workmates care about my health and continued
well-being.

I still have a snuffly nose which I hope will be better in
the morning.  I'd hate for me to miss our regular Sunday
rockclimbing and mexican feast due to some silly sickness.
<P>
<B>GnuCash</b><BR>
Spent a good part of the evening confessing to GnuCash all
my dark financial secrets.  I now know how much I own (a
bit), how much I owe (a bit), and how much that all works
out to be (a little bit).  For some reason this makes me
feel good, as I didn't really know all this before.
<P>
<B>Hardware</b><BR>
My webserver is emitting a funny `burning-plastic' kind of
smell, possibly because it's been covered with programming
references, newspapers, and old financial statements.  I've
unearthed the webserver to give it a bit more room to
breathe.  Since my nose is blocked I can't really mind the
smell.
