            <p><b>Saudi Arabian Adventures - Day 0</b><br>
<i>The events in this entry occurred on the 11th/12th June</i><br>
<p>
At the start of this year, Kirrily "Skud" Robert
<a href="http://infotrope.net/blog/2009/01/01/new-years-resolutions/">made
a remark</a> about new year resolutions that are easy and fun to keep.
As an example, she included "never turn down an adventure".
<p>
While I'm not one to make (or keep) new year resolutions, this one
stuck in my mind as a particularly good one to have.  While it's certainly
been a <i>fun</i> resolution, I disagree about it being easy to keep.
It's this particular resolution that had me stripping off to go swimming
in <a href="http://pix.cafuego.net/main.php/v/Marchsouth/dsc_0003.jpg.html">
waters of unknown depth, quality, and temperature</a> when travelling
around Tasmania with <a href="http://cafuego.net/">Peter</a>,
<a href="http://kattekrab.net/">Donna</a> and
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~jarich/journal/">Jacinta</a> after
<a href="http://lca2009.linux.org.au/">Linux.conf.au</a> this year.
<p>
The same resolution of "never turn down an adventure" now has me in
Saudi Arabia, giving a Perl course to the world's largest oil company.
It would have been easy for me not to be here.  As it happens, I arrived
only a day before my entry visa expired.  The amount of legwork
required to set up a trip like this for the first time is quite
considerable, and actually started back in Feburary!  So far, it certainly
has been an adventure.
<p>
It started with my flight from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai">Dubai</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dammam">Dammam</a>.  Emirates was kind
enough to upgrade me to business class, which was nice, and meant a
very comfortable flight.  At the end of the flight I
leisurely strolled off the plane and through the airport, looking
at the scenery and taking my time.  When I rounded the last corner,
I immediately realised I had made a terrible mistake.  Despite the
flight having lasted only an hour, I had flown internationally, with
hundreds of other people.  There would be passport control and
customs.  These things are rarely quick, and one <i>really</i> wants
to be at the front.
<p>
I found myself about three-quarters down the back of a queue, with
only a small number of passport control officers.  I noticed that
processing each person took a <i>long</i> time, maybe five minutes or
more, as they needed document checks, and fingerprints, and
photographs, and sometimes a short interview, and (if they looked
unwell) a check by doctors concerned about swine flu.  It was about
10pm at night, and after counting the people in front of me, and doing
some maths, I estimated I would be through passport control at
approximately 2am!
<p>
As luck would have it, another passport control officer was put on
duty, and I managed to get through customs after only a
three-and-a-half hour wait.  There was then a rather ominous moment
of me realising that while there were lots of drivers waiting with
signs and people's names, none of them held <i>my</i> name.  Luckily,
my driver had only gone to get a cup of tea (quite understandable
after 3.5 hrs waiting!), and we met after only a few minutes of me
wandering about looking lost.
<p>
After chatting a bit with the driver, I must admit that I slept
most of the trip to the hotel.  It seemed to involve the single
longest stretch of road possible; I woke up a few times, and we
were still on the same highway.  It also had what I could only
describe as christmas-tree lights strung along the edges (so one
didn't drive off into the desert), and all the electronic signs
(eg, roadwork ahead) were animated in such a way that if one
ever appeared in my web-browser, I would immediately add it to my
block-list.
<p>
After going through a number of security checkpoints (which I would
later learn are required for all entry and exits to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Aramco_Residential_Camp_in_Dhahran">Aramco campus</a>),
I finally arrived at my hotel.  This felt like being in America;
it had American power points, all the light-switches were the wrong
way around, and the lamps have these funny knobs that I keep turning
the wrong way.
<p>
At this point, most people would fall asleep, exhausted.  However I'm
equipped with the geek version of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow's
hierarchy of needs</a>, so the first thing I did upon arriving
was wake up the poor reception staff so I could be connected to
the wireless network, and <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/5205857">dent/tweet</a>
that I had arrived.

            <p><b>Dubai stopover</b><br>
I'm in Dubai for a 10 hour stopover between flights, and I'm loving
it already.  Having come from a very cold, very wet, and very dark
Melbourne, having a world that's bright and warm and humid is just
fantastic.  I'm itching to get to the beach, or walk across the
desert, or just go exploring generally.  I've already done some of
that in my local area, but I can't go too far as I still need to
get back in time to catch my flight.
<p>
Of course, getting into Dubai wasn't all fun and puppies.  The flight
was fourteen hours long, and while I had brought along sleeping tablets,
they seemed to work better at dulling my thinking while awake rather
than helping me sleep.  I don't remember sleeping on planes being
anywhere near this bad for my trips to the USA, but then again those
trips were done without me sleeping the night before.
<p>
Besides trouble sleeping, my biggest oops was forgetting that I
had brought <i>two</i> bags with me, rather than one.  Luckily,
the helpful Emirates staff were able to find my errant luggage,
and since Dubai airport has free wifi, I was happy to wait.
<p>
Customs seemed very relaxed, and while I was selected for 'additional
screening', that mostly consisted of chatting to the friendly
guard about how much extra battery life my laptop can get from
my external battery.  The best part was after the security guard
asked me to "step this way", he acknowledged that I had been on
a flight for 14 hours, and so if I wanted to duck out for a smoke,
that would be perfectly okay.  He looked very disappointed when I
said that I didn't smoke, and in hindsight <i>he</i> may have been
looking for an excuse to go to the smoking area. ;)
<p>
Currency conversion rates at the airport are nowhere near as bad
as they are in Australia, at least when converting from Aussie
Dollars to Saudi Riyals and UAE Dirhams.  Overall about 5% of my
money went on currency conversion, whereas in Australia it was hard
to find anyone who'd sell Riyals for less than 10%, plus waiting times.
<p>
The food so far has been excellent.  The aircraft food was tasty
(for aircraft food) and bountiful.  Emirates has given me a hotel
(quite spacious) at which to stay between my flights, and the hotel
comes with lunch (a huge buffet), dinner (an even bigger buffet), and
a "snack" (which looks like it's really "second lunch").  The food is
<i>really</i> good, there's a fantastic vegetarian selection, and
the service is excellent.  I can wholeheartedly say that I 
<i>like</i> the airport hotel.  ;)
<p>
My only problem with the hotel is that there are no tea or coffee
making facilities.  That's not a big downside, since I can always
walk downstairs with my "snack" voucher and be given a half dozen
cups of coffee, a pudding, a huge slice of cake, some very nice
freshly made creme caramels, and assorted morsels to "fill in the
edges".
<p>
Prices in touristy places seem about on-par with prices in Australia.
Prices outside of touristy places vary in my short experience with
them.  I went to a supermarket to refresh a few supplies, and found
fresh fruit and vegies at about the same prices in Australia.  However
the cans of coke and associated soft-drinks in the "impulse buy
fridge" were only 1 AED each, which is about $0.33 AUD.  Coffee at
the airport is the most surprisingly expensive, at the equivalent of
$7 AUD per cup!
<p>
Most ironic experience today was one of the locals pulling up in
his car and asking me for directions to the hospital.  Oddly enough,
I could give them, as I'd walked past the hospital on the way from
my hotel.
<p>
I'm now just about to hop on a flight to Saudi for my assignment
teaching Perl.  I may be out of Internet range for a while.

            <p><b>Teaching Perl in Saudi Arabia</b>
After what seems like an almost endless amount of paperwork, visa applications, immunisations, negotiations, contracts, travel agents, and administrivia, I'm about to fly to Saudi Arabia, to teach Perl to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Aramco">the world's biggest oil company</a>.
<p>
Why are they learning Perl?  Well, as best I can tell, they're using it for data munging of geological data.  That's got a familiar ring to it, in fact I've been seeing a big growth of <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=566">Perl in Geoscience</a> recently.
<p>
On the way back I'm planning to spend a couple of days in Dubai, just because it sounds like such a bizarrely opulent part of the world.  World's biggest hotel.  World's biggest indoor ski slope.  World's biggest shopping mall, and certainly the closest thing we have to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/guide/magrathea.shtml">Magrathea</a>, with Dubai creating artificial islands in the shapes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Islands">palm trees</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_(archipelago)">the world itself</a>.  I also hear the diving is pretty good.

            <p><b>My strange working habits</b><br>
After far too long on the road, I've been in Melbourne for a whole week.  In theory, I get to spend at least another 10 days here before my next flight, which (provided the last piece of paperwork gets signed) will be to Saudi Arabia.
<p>
This week, when it comes to interesting FOSS stuff, I've done absolutely nothing.  What I've discovered is that when I'm on the road, I keep squeezing in bits of work around the edges.  A lot of my coding gets done in departure lounges, and for my last trips to Canberra, on a bus.  However when I'm home, I can <i>relax</i>.  I can sleep in, be comfortable, and have <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/4712036">long, drawn-out breakfasts</a>.  I have friends, real ones, that I can see and spend time with.  In short, I have all the things of which I've been completely deprived while travelling.
<p>
While this is great for recharging my batteries, it's not great in terms of deliverable productivity.  If you're waiting on me to complete or review a piece of code, you have my most sincere apologies.  Feel free to keep nudging me, it does help.

These are great for the starting player, and easily fold up for storage, but as one's dance moves become more dynamic and energetic, they rapidly start to crumple, crease, and slide.
<p>
For years, I'd dreamed about having a rigid dance platform.  Last year, at <a href="http://linux.conf.au/">Linux.conf.au</a>, I was lucky enough to take home <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pfenwick/2237511281/">a plywood and cork tile</a> homebrew creation, courtesy of Tamara Olliver, who constructed it as part of a talk at the conference.  The mat worked pretty well, and I even <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=529">added some retro buttons</a>, but I had problems with it mis-firing.  The mesh connectors would fray with heavy use, and then tend to stick together.  I still had dreams of a metal dance mat, but the cost of shipping to Australia put these way out of the price range I was willing to spend on one.
<p>
Well, a couple of weeks ago, I found an eBay supplier who was selling metal dance mats in Australia, with a delivered cost of $150 after some creative investigation and use of the "best offer" button.  The mats looked like they were clones of <a href="http://www.play-asia.com/SOap-23-83-7uq3-71-88-84-j-70-29f.html">TX-1000 series</a>.  Having not seen an offer like this for years, I purchased two.
<p>
Now, the TX-1000 is the cheapest, nastiest metal dance mat one can find, and I knew this, but they still beat any soft mat one cares to play with.  The original ones used tiles that would "float" on a bed of foam, with the corners removed and a heavy-duty bolt in each position, to ensure each pad couldn't move away from where it was supposed to be.  This is similar to many arcade setups, and works pretty well.  That meant that while all the components in these pads are cheap, but at least the engineering principle was sound.  One could expect the tiles to last a couple of months before they needed to be replaced.
<p>
Of course, what <i>I</i> got was a cheap-and-nasty version of an already cheap-and-nasty pad.  Rather than each pad having four bolts (a total of 24 in total), there are only four bolts on the entire board.  Rather than the tiles "floating" on foam, they still have the foam underneath, but each tile is now supported on three edges by the side of the dance platform, and internal supports.  The pads tiles now flex to make contact with the underlying sensor.
<p>
At first, this doesn't sound too bad, until I tell you that the <a href="http://www.play-asia.com/SOap-23-83-7uq3-71-88-84-j-70-3ie.html">tiles are acrylic</a>, which is not an impact resistant material.  Because the tiles are now flexing, their lifespan goes from months down to days.
<p>
So, I now own two awesome metal dance mats, each one with a number of not-so-awesome broken tiles.  This isn't as big a deal as one may think, the tiles have a rubber underlay that holds them together, so the dance mat still continues to work more-or-less as before.  However the nice 'foot-feel' is impaired, and with enough damage, they tiles may actually become unusable.
<p>
I'm not too upset about this.  For $150 a mat, I didn't expect a first-class dancing platform, and the mats are <i>extremely</i> easy to service; the tiles are easily removed and replaced, and the electronics are simple to get to.  So, I'm looking to replace each tile with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycarbonate">polycarbonate</a>, also known as <i>bulletproof glass</i>.  There are some fun <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsls5ZPCUnE">acrylic vs polycarbonate</a> videos that demonstrate the difference in impact resistance, and I'm pretty sure that polycarb will be tough enough for what I need.
<p>
I've found a supplier, but unfortunately polycarb seems to come in a standard engineering size of 1.2 x 2.4m, which is about three times what I need.  If I had six dance mats, or could just pay for the materials I need, then each tile comes to about $6 each, including professional cutting, which I think is a great deal.  I'm calling around to see if I can find a supplier who's got an off-cut, or maybe a salvage yard that has some odds and ends.
<p>
To complete my StepMania setup, yesterday was spent modding furniture.  Our lounge-room AV cabinet would fit our old CRT television, but not the new Plasma TV that Jacinta won at the <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">Open Source Developers Conference</a> last year, and as such the new TV has mostly been sitting in storage.  After some discussions on the best way to succeed, and with the help of a new electric <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigsaw_(power_tool)">jig-saw</a>, the TV cavity in the cabinet was enlarged, the ends painted, and the new TV fitted.  Jacinta did all the hard cutting, since she actually has wood-working experience, and I don't.
<p>
The new set-up is <i>so much nicer</i> than previously.  The TV takes inputs from just about anything, and forwards its audio to the stereo, so there's much less futzing around with splitter boxes.  It also takes an analogue VGA input, and while my laptop's analogue VGA doesn't seem to want to talk to anything else, it loves talking to the TV.  As such, the laptop has been spending a lot of time connected, with StepMania being played, or media being watched.
<p>
My only problem is that I feel sad when disconnecting the laptop.  My lounge-room changes from a totally awesome StepMania and gaming heaven into just a lounge-room, with just a TV.  I think now is the time to finally put together a dedicated <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> box.  My plan is to convince Jacinta that she wants a new laptop, since her old laptop is showing signs of stress on the internal VGA cabling, it's the prime candidate for being re-purposed.
<p>
So, if you happen to be in Melbourne, and have a source of 2-3mm polycarbonate, or feel like showing me your awesome dance moves, now's a good time to visit. ;)
