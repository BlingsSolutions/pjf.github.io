[TW: Discusses religious intolerance, and violence against women.]

You, or someone you know, may make the argument that the burqa—a traditional
full-body, face-covering article of women's clothing—should be banned or
discouraged because it oppresses women.

I'm not interested in debating whether or not it oppresses women or not; but I
can tell you that calling for its ban *is* harming Australian women, right now.

You've probably noticed there's been quite a bit of Islamophobia recently. Of
course, *you* believe in religious freedom, and you're definitely not a racist.
Your stance on the burqa is only because you believe in gender equality, right?

Unfortunately, there seem to be lots of people out there with bigoted views. I
won't link to it, but the "ban the burqa" page on Facebook is nothing but
racial and religious intolerance and hatred. I couldn't find anything about it
existing to promote equal rights for women.

And here's the problem, by saying that you think the burqa should banned, it's
*very* easy to think you're a hateful bigot, because they're the sort of people
who are really getting behind this. By saying you feel the burqa should be
banned, It's very easy to think you're against *any* sort of islamic
head-covering, even something as simple as a scarf. And it doesn't even matter
if you say that you actually care about gender equality, because all the
racists and bigots out there will know that you're secretly on their side.
They'll feel that you justify their hatred. They'll feel you're *one of them*.

What's worse, by doing this, you fuel hatred towards the very women you are
trying to help. The level of Islamaphobia in Australia right now is both
horrible and completely unjustified, and by expressing these views you're
increasing the hate and aggression suffered by perfectly innocent, law-abiding
women *who just want to go about their lives*.

If you're trying to be an ally, you're being the shittiest ally ever.

So, what can you do? Well, if you *actually* care about gender equality, then
you should get out there and talk about *that*. Working towards gender equality
improves our society *for everyone*. Argue that women *in general* should be
free to wear *whatever they want*, be that a burqa or a mini-skirt,
*without fear of violence*. Argue that we should have greater funding for
survivors of domestic and sexual abuse. Argue that we should have greater
education opportunities, and *especially* for disadvantaged and marginalised
groups; education is one of the greatest changes one can take towards removing
oppression of any kind.

In other words, go forth and *be a feminist*. You don't have to use that
label, but if you're truly trying to improve gender equality, then take
steps towards doing that *for everyone*.

But please, don't go about saying we should ban an article of women's clothing.
It makes *you* look like a bigot, and it only harms the very women you're
trying to protect.
