On Sunday, 16th August I made a [pledge][]. A lifelong pledge to give 10% of my income to causes that do the most good.

This is something I should have done a long time ago, and for years I had found excuses not to do so. I was saving for a house. I was building financial security. It wasn't *my* fault that injustice and hardship existed elsewhere in the world.

But it is. It's totally my fault.

The food I eat is transported and grown with petroleum products which [support corrupt regimes][equatorial-guinea] that keep people in poverty. The electricity that powers my laptop, the trains that I catch, and the public lighting I enjoy, comes from environmental destruction and greenhouse gas emission. The animal products I use are the result of cruelty and suffering.

My personal choices can lessen the negative impact I make on the world, but no amount of being car-free or using green energy will eliminate the damage I'm causing. But there is something I *can* do. I can take responsibility. I can try to make amends.

I live in one of the richest countries on Earth. I have financial, health, housing, and food security. I have valuable and transferrable skills. I've had [opportunities][] that much of the world's population—even those here in Australia—simply never had. At a relatively small cost to me I can make a large difference elsewhere, and I feel it is my moral obligation to do so.

The most effective charities in the world are *very* effective. 200 *million* people suffer from malaria each year, and of those, up to 800,000 will die. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), 500 people die *per day*, the vast majority of which are children under five.

But you know what stops malaria? Bed-nets. Treated with insecticide, these not only protect the people they're distributed to, but they kill the mosquitoes that spread disease, protecting the entire community.

The cost of distributing a net in the DRC—one of the most difficult places in the world to work—is about $7.50 USD, inclusive of all expenses, which include follow-up studies to ensure correct deployment and use. For every thousand children protected with nets, 5.5 lives are saved¹.

The cost-per-life-saved is a little higher than one may get from naive calculations; not every net is used effectively, nets need to be replaced over time, and there are other factors at play. [GiveWell][] estimates a cost of [just under $3,500 USD per life saved][life-saved]. Through lifelong giving I have the opportunity to impact *many* lives, and to do genuine good in the world.

To make sure I remain committed to this pledge, Thomas Hendrey has pledged with me, and we'll be checking each other's progress each year. But I would also like *you* to join me in doing good. Even if you [pledge just 1%][1pc] of your income for a year, that's a real diffence that can be made. I've chosen to do this in conjunction with [Giving What We Can][], as they provide tracking and support for pledgers, but I am also personally willing to provide social support in helping you keep that pledge. One of my biggest psychological barriers was finding other people to join me in doing good.
