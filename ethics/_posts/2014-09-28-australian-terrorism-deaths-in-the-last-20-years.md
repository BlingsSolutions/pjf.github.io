I've discovered the [Global Terrorism Database](http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd).
It records over 125,000 terrorist incidents since 1970. It's easy to
search by country, sort by fatalities, and find more information about
incidents.

Today I discovered that the total number of deaths from terrorism in
Australia in the last twenty years is *three*, and none of them were
Australian citizens.
They were [asylum seekers](http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/IncidentSummary.aspx?gtdid=200904160031), heading to Australia.

I honestly don't know what to say.
