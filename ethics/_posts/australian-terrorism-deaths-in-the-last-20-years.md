description: "Australia has 3 deaths to terrorism in the last 20 years. All were asylum seekers."

**Note**: I discovered there were 8 deaths, not three. As such I've
pulled this back to draft mode. I may do a full write-up later, but
I value truth immensely, and do not wish to misreport the situation.

I've discovered the [Global Terrorism Database](http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd).
It records over 125,000 terrorist incidents since 1970. It's easy to
search by country, sort by fatalities, and find more information about
incidents.

Today I discovered that the total number of deaths from terrorism in
Australia [in the last twenty years](http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/Results.aspx?page=1&casualties_type=&casualties_max=&country=14&charttype=line&chart=overtime&expanded=no&ob=TotalNumberOfFatalities&od=desc#results-table) is *three*, and none of them were Australian citizens.

They were [asylum seekers](http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/IncidentSummary.aspx?gtdid=200904160031), heading to Australia.

I honestly don't know what to say.
