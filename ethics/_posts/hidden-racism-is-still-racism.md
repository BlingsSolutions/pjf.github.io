The people in the 1950s didn't think of themselves as being sexist. This was the culture in which they had been raised. At the same time, this same culture came with a burden of injustice: your gender radically altered the opportunities that life would afford you¹.

We see the same thing today with racism and fiction. There's an assumption in English literature that unless stated otherwise, characters are white. Many books don't mention *anything* about the race of their characters, but when they're converted to fan-art, movies, or book-covers, white is almost always what we see.

I'll take Hermione from the Harry Potter universe as a case in point... she's introduced as having bushy brown hair and large teeth. Nothing is said about her race. To the best of my knowledge the only time her skin colour is mentioned is in the Prisoner of Azkaban:

> “They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor — Ron looking incredibly freckly, Hermione very brown, both waving frantically at him.”

Hermione *very brown*. There's no reason why Hermione couldn't be a person of colour, but if she were to be portrayed this way in the movies then it would have been a *very* big deal. A world in which it's the norm for fictional characters to be considered white *is* a racist world, but it's something we may not think about unless explicitly challenged to do so.


The invisible racism that exists is a product of our society, which means we will act in ways which are racist without even being aware that there's a problem, myself included. It's uncomfortable to be reminded of this, and it's easy to be angry at a society that allows it to persist. That means that a lot of discussions regarding race are going to be charged with emotion. This means that there will be conflict, especially when it means changing the status quo. However I don't believe that means we should shy away from these conversations; if we do, then the *future* will suffer for it, and someone in the 2080s will be using our current society as an example of how we didn't think that we were racist.

¹ Gender and many other factors *still* have an enormous impact on opportunities, but it's much easier to see this through the lens of history.
