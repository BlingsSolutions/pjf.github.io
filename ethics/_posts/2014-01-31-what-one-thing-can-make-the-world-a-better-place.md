Many people have the dream of being a successful writer.  There's an allure
with having one's work read by others, but with the advent of the web the
business of writing has changed. One no longer seeks a publisher, but traffic
and high rankings on search engines. One no longer expects royalties, but
instead revenue is generated from advertisements and affiliate links. Hardly an
hour goes past without a piece of email landing in my mailbox offering "Search
Engine Optimisation".  The language of the web is now monetization and
impressions, click-throughs and channels.

If monetization were my goal, then you'd see advertisements on this website;
but you won't. At least, not the way you'd expect.

It's commonplace at the end of an article to prompt the reader to stick around,
often by displaying links to other articles. But I want my readers to go or do
whatever brings the greatest good; I want them to take actions that will make
the world a better place. That could be bringing them happiness, or education,
or—ideally—having them actively try to change the world for the better. It
would be profoundly ignorant of me to think that reading *my* content is the
most optimal way of doing that.

At the end of every article, I'd like to direct the reader to whatever
will bring the greatest good. That could be something as simple as a
[funny cat video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKffm2uI4dk); making people
smile *is* bringing good to the world.  But I think we can do better.

Right now, I'm encouraging people to read
[3 myths that block progress for the poor](http://annualletter.gatesfoundation.org/) after
{% t Quintrino %} brought it to my attention. It's an incredible piece; well-written and
researched. If you have the time, I strong encourage you to read and share it.

My most popular article has to do with how
[beliefs can influence learning](/ethics/2014/01/25/how-to-screw-learning-with-one-simple-belief.html),
with over 35,000 hits in the last five days. I have evidence that it's
particularly popular with parents, so at this very moment time *they* are my
target audience. However I'm interested in *all* suggestions as to what I can
encourage readers to do next; even my own content, if you think that's
appropriate. I can possibly even use some technomancy to empirically test
which links readers find most appealing.

So, if you could have people see just one link, what would it be, and why?
