            <B>CyberSource Bash</b><BR>
<A HREF="/person/dancer">Dancer</a> invited me to the <A
HREF="http://www.cyber.com.au/">CyberSource</a> end of year
bash so I could catch up with him and generally hang out
with other geeks.  We caught up over a couple of scotch and
drys, and I also found myself bumping into some old
associates who I hadn't seem in quite some time.  All up I
had a very enjoyable time.
<P>
I'll be trying to find the time to send a letter or two off
to a couple of the CyberSource crew.  If nothing else I want
to better understand how they work, and if I end up doing
some work on the side I won't be dissapointed.

Been effectively working two jobs.  I'm still doing my day
job (9 working days to go), but at night I'm handling
consultancy stuff.  This means I've pretty much been living
off coffee.  I am <I>really</i> looking forward to the end
of this week so I can get some rest.
<P>
<B>You know you're a geek when...</b><BR>
Your partner comes to you with the perl script from
Cryptonomicon claiming that she may have found some syntax
problems, but after further discussion it's discovered that
it's just the formatting that's misleading.  Furthermore,
you go on to have a meaningful discussion about how they
could probably have the script run faster if they avoided
the use of $&amp;.

            <B>Work - The Big Day</b><BR>
Well, the big day approaches.  It's out on the grapevine
now, so I might as well place it in my diary.  I'm resigning
from my current employer to become a consultant.  The
reasons are long and varied, the one I most fond of goes
something like this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
I find I never have enough time in the day to do everything
I want.  The two things that take up the most time are work
and sleep, and I'm unwilling to give up sleep.
</i></blockquote>
<P>
That sums it up nicely, I guess.  I want a life again. 
Currently I'm doing management work, not coding, not design,
not the things I'm good at, nor the things I want to be
learning.  Sure, I make a great catalyst.  My presence helps
everyone else do their jobs and work more effectively, but I
don't actually seem to get any work done myself because I'm
too busy shunting work.
<P>
Can I say I'm happy about leaving my job?  Well, I'm
certainly happy for me -- I've got plenty of people jumping
at the chance to grab me as a consultant, so I'm not too
concerned about not getting work.  Likewise, if things do go
badly I've got a good chunk of savings and a few standing
invitations to go back to full-time employment.  I stand to
gain a lot -- my home office is underneath an apricot tree,
I'll be working with some of the most clueful people I've
ever met, and there'll be opportunities for me to learn the
things I'm interested in and do the things I want to do. 
The risk is well worth the potential gain here.
<P>
However
there are some people I will miss, and who I know will find
things harder when I'm gone.  To those people, I'm sorry.  I
love working with you, you're great people, but I'm going to
go insane if I continue with things the way they are.  I'm
sure that we won't lose touch, in fact I very very much hope
that we can work together again in the future.
<P>
Right now I'm trying to write my final letter to submit on
Friday.  It's certainly not the easiest of tasks, and I'd
like things to go as smoothly as possible with me leaving.  
It won't go smoothly, of course, there's no denying that
I'll be leaving a rather large hole, but I'm hoping I can
put forward recommendations that will help.
<P>
It's getting late, and I should be getting home before
dark.  I'm sure I'll have much more to write before all of
this is over.

Been stupidly busy recently.  There's a lot of people who's
mail I haven't replied to, and lots to write but not enough
time to do so.

Got some interesting news I'll post the next few days.

            <B>Neighbours</b><BR>
Met our neighbours today, with whom we share a wall. 
They're extremely cool.  They're geeks (like us), they're
about our age, they're vegan (we're vegetarian), they're
interested in sustainable living, and they know all the same
people we know.  They're very friendly, and have been kind
enough to offer a length of CAT-5 over the fence (or to
drill a hole through the wall) to give us decent network
connectivity until our new line gets put in.
<P>
Gave them some Earth Garden magazines to read and a free
copy of TPJ #19.  We're probably going to go out to dinner
this weekend, and maybe go along the Merri Creek to go
spotting edible plants.  Oh yes, they also like chickens and
ducks.
<P>
The bad news about the neighbours is that they're only
renting, so potentially they may leave at some point to
be replaced with boring neighbours.  I hope this
doesn't happen.
