<p>It all began with Addie MenacedCluster reporting that great dingoes had been spotted out in the woods. This truly seems to be a land of giants, and these beasts are no exception:</p>

<p><img alt='' src='http://i.imgur.com/l9acNaC.png' /></p>

<p>Given what happened the last time warlock merchants were in camp, I feel justified in being very cautious about the approach of <em>any</em> wild animal. Our front-line squads are put on high alert, and not a moment too soon, as while the dingoes keep their distance, a much more terrifying threat appears:</p>

<p>Despite us being far from our homes in this frozen waste, it appears that not only are we crawling in traders, but they are unable to unpack their goods without setting <em>something</em> on fire. Imagine my surprise when I made a show of SageEthereal and myself being at the depot to greet them, only to find ourselves surrounded by flames. At first I thought the hill orcs were retaliating due to the senseless loss of their kinsfolk in the trade fire a month before, but it appears that they obtained a <em>barrel of dragonfire</em>—no doubt from the warlocks—and were eager to show us their wares.</p>

<p>&#8220;UngodlyPetal, my sweet, we have been searching the wildernesss for a long time to find a place we can call home. What do you think of this place?&#8221; asked LonelyZeus.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like it, WebbedStolen dearest,&#8221; said Hostergaard, sipping on a small bottle of disease resistant draught that she kept in a flask in case of contact with dwarves. &#8220;And we have family! What a delight it was to find Jaxy LyingBolts and Talthra Wraithlikepainted out here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they do seem to be making a name for themselves. I wonder how Talthra&#8217;s children are doing back home? Little TortureSold and GreaterCursed. Such lovely names.&#8221;</p>

<p>CptCrunchy sat by the smoking remains of a lynx bone table. As tribe scribe, he took his duties very seriously. While he insisted that to properly account for the tribe&#8217;s possessions he needed a better dining room, and living quaters, and study, and maybe a few trophies, he knew all of those would come in time. But for now, he had rolled by the sleve of his cotton fibre shirt to best show off his scars to their new guests.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>His left forearm bears a massive straight scar. His right hand bears a massive curving scar. His right foot bears a very long straight scar. His third toe, right foot, is gone.</p>
