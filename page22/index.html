                <p><b>autodie status update</b><br>
I just looked through my blog history, and discovered the last release of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?autodie">autodie</a>, I've blogged about was version 1.99!  Since then, there's been nine releases!  For those of you new to my blog, autodie is a lexical pragma that allows Perl's built-ins to throw exceptions on failure, which can take your error-handling from cumbersome to simple.
<p>
There's been a lot of changes in those nine releases, and the <a href="http://github.com/pfenwick/autodie/tree/master/Changes">Changes</a> file documents all the significant ones.  There are nicer error messages, better coverage of Perl's core functions, fewer rough edges, and lots more tests.  If you're not one to go reading Changes files, I can assure you that upgrading to 1.999 is pleasant and surprise-free.
<p>
I've had a few people tease me about the silly version number, 1.999 threatens to have 1.9991 as a next release, but this will not happen.  The next version of autodie will be 2.000, and this actually represents a significant change.  There's no backwardly incompatible changes, but there is a new feature which greatly extends autodie's ability to detect failures in non-core subroutines.
<p>
Presently, one can write:

        <div class="p-summary">
            
                <p><b>Rotorua</b><br>
In February as part of my New Zealand adventure I made it to KiwiFoo (aka BaaCamp).  The trip to KiwiFoo was an adventure in itself, with Jacinta and myself giving talks at Wellington Perl Mongers and Waikato LUG, and spending a short time in Rotorua (our "tourist day").
<p>
Rotorua was unfortunately heavily touristified, and I noticed a few of the locals calling it "RotorVegas".  It wasn't hard to see why; there were lots of ways to separate the tourists from their cash, and many of the local attractions felt very artificial as a result.  It didn't help that I knew the local geysers were so "reliable" due to an ample addition of soap powder at the times they're supposed to blow.
<p>
Somewhat repulsed by the highly commercial offerings, we went looking for some more authentic experiences off the beaten track.  Some time walking around one of the geothermal areas revealed a brightly coloured steaming pool behind a "No Entry" sign.  I wondered just how hot the water could be, and my scalded finger assured me it was almost at boiling point.  Pipes from a nearby hotel snaked their way into the pool, obviously making use of the ample heat it provided.
<p>
After a much longer walk, Jacinta and myself found our way to the Redwoods, which made for an excellent few hours hiking.  With sore feet, and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Closed">Conan the Detective</a> drink bottle we discovered along the walk, we returned to the hotel.
<p>
Our hotel had the rather tacky name of "GeyserLand", but true to its name we had an excellent view of a mud pool and geyser directly outside our hotel window.  The heat in Rotorua was oppressive; the air was humid, we were experiencing a "heat wave", and the local geothermal activity naturally added to both.  The hotel room didn't have air conditioning, so staying in didn't appeal.
<p>
The hotel had a swimming pool for guests, which seemed attractive, but it didn't remain open particularly late.  It also had "spout pools" which could be hired for a modest fee, but the hotel services guide contained no information about these might be.  I figured they were some sort of geothermally heated bath.
<p>
Jacinta and I went to the desk to find out a little more and potentially hire a pool, and were told we couldn't hire one, because they were just about to close.  "Oh no," I cried with my best pout, "We've travelled all the way from Australia, and this is our only night in Rotorua...  I had <i>so</i> hoped to enjoy a thermal pool before I left."
<p>
A few minutes later we had access to a "spout pool", free of charge, because the hotel couldn't monitor our usage after they'd closed up reception for the night.  Consequently, we also had access to the pool for as long as we wanted.
<p>
The pool ended up being the highlight of the entire day.  Rather than a tiny thing that would only fit two people, this would have comfortably fit six unfriendly people, or almost twice that in friendly people.  Hot water (presumably heated underground) falls from a spout into the pool, which would be waist-deep if you stood up, but which contains seats at just the right level to bring the water to neck height.  It was clear that the water wasn't being recycled, it was just pumped in fresh 24 hours a day.  I felt rather jealous of New Zealand's ample water supplies; in Melbourne it hadn't rained for two months, and water usage came with tight restrictions.
<p>
My dive computer (which I routinely wear instead of a wristwatch) told me the water was about 36'C, which made it <i>lovely</i> to relax in.  If I ever return to the hotel, I'll be sure to bring a number of friends and a bottle of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sake">sake</a>.
<p>
The next day we were off to Waikato (Cambridge and Hamilton) en route to Auckland and then Warkworth.  We went and visited a local nature park (with an obligatory kiwi tour) and had a nice lunch in town.  Everything looked pretty good until we got onto the bus, where I had discovered we'd booked our tickets for the wrong week.  After a little pleading and cajoling with the bus driver and assurances that we wouldn't even be in the country the next week, we were allowed on anyway, despite our tickets being invalid.
<p>
Waikato was another adventure again, and one I hope to discuss in my next journal entry.

                <p><b>Wellington Adventures</b><br>
I'm currently sitting in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington">Wellington</a> airport, New Zealand.  It's the most civilised airport I've ever seen.  Rather than standing in a queue forever with tickets, there are kiosks which weigh one's bag and prints baggage and boarding passes.  One then places the bags on a conveyor belt, and walks to the departure gate.  It's wonderfully laid back, with no screening for weapons, sharp objects, or dangerous liquids like toothpaste and coffee.  At the departure lounge there are plenty of power points, and a completely open access point (albeit with the odd SSID of <i>router</i>).  In about 15 minutes I'll be on my plane to I'm on my way to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotorua">Rotorua</a>, where I'll be a tourist for a whole 24 hours.
<p>
For those who haven't been following my <a href="http://identi.ca/pjf/">dents</a> or trips on <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/pjf/public">dopplr</a>, I'm ostensibly in New Zealand for <a href="http://baacamp.org/">Baa Camp</a>, but that's not until the weekend.  Until then, I'm travelling, and mostly staying with geeks while doing so.
<p>
For the last two nights, I've been staying with <a href="http://grantmclean.vox.com/">Grant</a> and Anna McLean, who have a beautiful house and the nicest and best behaved kids I've ever met.  Grant runs the local <a href="http://wellington.pm.org/">Wellington Perl Mongers</a>, where both Jacinta and myself had the honour of speaking last night.
<p>
As I discovered, Wellington also has the most civilised Perl Mongers group I've ever seen.  They provide beer and munchies <i>during</i> the meeting.  I was very glad to see both <a href="http://coffee.geek.nz/">Brenda</a>, <a href="http://andrew.mcmillan.net.nz/">Andrew</a>, and <a href="http://vilain.net/">Sam</a> at the meeting; Wellington is certainly spoilt when it comes to having distinguished people.  It's also spoilt for cafes; I could hardly walk five steps in the city centre without encountering a barista.
<p>
My next public appearance will be at <a href="http://www.wlug.org.nz/MeetingTopics.2009-02-12">Waikato LUG</a> on Thursday.  If you're in the area, I'd love to see you there.

                <p><b>Linux.conf.au 2009</b><br>
I'm sitting on a pristine beach.  Nearby, a bee that's almost the
size of my thumb lazily makes its way between the fragrant violet
flowers on the tree that provides my shade.  The sun is warm,
but not too hot, and a few small sailing craft are out on the
water, enjoying the mild weather and light winds.  Beyond the
water a breathtaking range of mountains rise.  In the water,
a wetsuited man swims to a nearby moored boat, while nesting
gulls swoop him from overhead, and a flotilla of ducks cautiously
follow, hopeful for an easy meal.
<p>
You'd be excused to think that I was on holidays, but actually
I'm at <a href="http://linux.conf.au/">Linux.conf.au</a> (LCA), which this
year is being held in Hobart, Tasmania.  Tasmania has always been
known for its breathtaking landscapes, pristine wilderness, and
excellent beer.  Having spent the last week here, I can assure you
that Tasmania has all these things in abundance.
<p>
Like most conferences, one has to make a choice at LCA: talks,
social, sleep; pick two.  Since I fell into my usual bad habit of
working on my slides and presentations during the conference period,
I was really only able to pick one; in this case, I picked social.
<p>
This year I seem to be a lot more trendy than I'm used to, and this
was even before I gave my talks.  I've been invited to the exclusive
dinners, I was readily included in conversations with authors of
famous books and software, and there was a most touching moment where
one of the local University of Tasmania students told me that he
managed to get a number of registrations based purely upon my
<a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=525">lightning talk from last year</a>.
<p>
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~jarich/journal">Jacinta</a> had the first talks for the conference, both of which
occurred on the Monday LinuxChix mini-conf.  Her talk
<i>On Speaking</i> had the audience in rapture and easily
rates as one of the best talks, if not <i>the</i> best talk I
saw at the entire conference.
<p>
For my talks, I had one scheduled presentation, and
<i>three</i> unscheduled ones, one of which was a lightning
talk.  The other two talks were due to a speaker giving notice
of a late cancellation, and I happened to have a few talks that
were ready to go.
<p>
For my fill-in talks, I gave my talk on
<a href="http://lca2009.linux.org.au/programme/schedule/view_talk/228"><i>The Art of Klingon Programming</i> and 
<i>What's New in Perl 5.10</i></a> (heavily revised from the
talk I gave before 5.10 was released).  Some vanity searching
revealed some excellent feedback with regards to these talk,
which I'm really happy with, because they weren't as polished
as I would have liked them to be.
<p>
My main talk was <a href="http://lca2009.linux.org.au/programme/schedule/view_talk/175"><i>Awesome Things You've Missed in Perl</i></a>,
discussed a range of new Perl technologies, many of which have
only been written in the last two years.  My lightning talk was a small mention of <a href="http://petdance.com/ack/">ack, a better grep</a>, which ended up winning one of the (three) awards for best lightning talk.  Next year I'm going to have to give a lightning talk on how to give good lightning talks.
<p>
The most newsworthy event (at least by local media standards) was
the Penguin Dinner.  As is the custom, we had a charity auction at dinner,
in this case to raise money for the <a href="http://www.tassiedevil.com.au/">Save The Tasmanian Devil foundation</a>.
Part-way through the bidding process, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bdale_Garbee">Bdale Garbee</a> made a commitment
to shave his beard if the money raised was more than a certain
amount.  While I wasn't able to keep track of all the pledges and contributions, the result was a final amount of money raised that approached
the $40,000 AUD mark, and Bdale lost his beard.
