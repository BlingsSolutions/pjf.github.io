                <p><b>Wellington Adventures</b><br>
I'm currently sitting in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington">Wellington</a> airport, New Zealand.  It's the most civilised airport I've ever seen.  Rather than standing in a queue forever with tickets, there are kiosks which weigh one's bag and prints baggage and boarding passes.  One then places the bags on a conveyor belt, and walks to the departure gate.  It's wonderfully laid back, with no screening for weapons, sharp objects, or dangerous liquids like toothpaste and coffee.  At the departure lounge there are plenty of power points, and a completely open access point (albeit with the odd SSID of <i>router</i>).  In about 15 minutes I'll be on my plane to I'm on my way to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotorua">Rotorua</a>, where I'll be a tourist for a whole 24 hours.
<p>
For those who haven't been following my <a href="http://identi.ca/pjf/">dents</a> or trips on <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/pjf/public">dopplr</a>, I'm ostensibly in New Zealand for <a href="http://baacamp.org/">Baa Camp</a>, but that's not until the weekend.  Until then, I'm travelling, and mostly staying with geeks while doing so.
<p>
For the last two nights, I've been staying with <a href="http://grantmclean.vox.com/">Grant</a> and Anna McLean, who have a beautiful house and the nicest and best behaved kids I've ever met.  Grant runs the local <a href="http://wellington.pm.org/">Wellington Perl Mongers</a>, where both Jacinta and myself had the honour of speaking last night.
<p>
As I discovered, Wellington also has the most civilised Perl Mongers group I've ever seen.  They provide beer and munchies <i>during</i> the meeting.  I was very glad to see both <a href="http://coffee.geek.nz/">Brenda</a>, <a href="http://andrew.mcmillan.net.nz/">Andrew</a>, and <a href="http://vilain.net/">Sam</a> at the meeting; Wellington is certainly spoilt when it comes to having distinguished people.  It's also spoilt for cafes; I could hardly walk five steps in the city centre without encountering a barista.
<p>
My next public appearance will be at <a href="http://www.wlug.org.nz/MeetingTopics.2009-02-12">Waikato LUG</a> on Thursday.  If you're in the area, I'd love to see you there.

                <p><b>Linux.conf.au 2009</b><br>
I'm sitting on a pristine beach.  Nearby, a bee that's almost the
size of my thumb lazily makes its way between the fragrant violet
flowers on the tree that provides my shade.  The sun is warm,
but not too hot, and a few small sailing craft are out on the
water, enjoying the mild weather and light winds.  Beyond the
water a breathtaking range of mountains rise.  In the water,
a wetsuited man swims to a nearby moored boat, while nesting
gulls swoop him from overhead, and a flotilla of ducks cautiously
follow, hopeful for an easy meal.
<p>
You'd be excused to think that I was on holidays, but actually
I'm at <a href="http://linux.conf.au/">Linux.conf.au</a> (LCA), which this
year is being held in Hobart, Tasmania.  Tasmania has always been
known for its breathtaking landscapes, pristine wilderness, and
excellent beer.  Having spent the last week here, I can assure you
that Tasmania has all these things in abundance.
<p>
Like most conferences, one has to make a choice at LCA: talks,
social, sleep; pick two.  Since I fell into my usual bad habit of
working on my slides and presentations during the conference period,
I was really only able to pick one; in this case, I picked social.
<p>
This year I seem to be a lot more trendy than I'm used to, and this
was even before I gave my talks.  I've been invited to the exclusive
dinners, I was readily included in conversations with authors of
famous books and software, and there was a most touching moment where
one of the local University of Tasmania students told me that he
managed to get a number of registrations based purely upon my
<a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=525">lightning talk from last year</a>.
<p>
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~jarich/journal">Jacinta</a> had the first talks for the conference, both of which
occurred on the Monday LinuxChix mini-conf.  Her talk
<i>On Speaking</i> had the audience in rapture and easily
rates as one of the best talks, if not <i>the</i> best talk I
saw at the entire conference.
<p>
For my talks, I had one scheduled presentation, and
<i>three</i> unscheduled ones, one of which was a lightning
talk.  The other two talks were due to a speaker giving notice
of a late cancellation, and I happened to have a few talks that
were ready to go.
<p>
For my fill-in talks, I gave my talk on
<a href="http://lca2009.linux.org.au/programme/schedule/view_talk/228"><i>The Art of Klingon Programming</i> and 
<i>What's New in Perl 5.10</i></a> (heavily revised from the
talk I gave before 5.10 was released).  Some vanity searching
revealed some excellent feedback with regards to these talk,
which I'm really happy with, because they weren't as polished
as I would have liked them to be.
<p>
My main talk was <a href="http://lca2009.linux.org.au/programme/schedule/view_talk/175"><i>Awesome Things You've Missed in Perl</i></a>,
discussed a range of new Perl technologies, many of which have
only been written in the last two years.  My lightning talk was a small mention of <a href="http://petdance.com/ack/">ack, a better grep</a>, which ended up winning one of the (three) awards for best lightning talk.  Next year I'm going to have to give a lightning talk on how to give good lightning talks.
<p>
The most newsworthy event (at least by local media standards) was
the Penguin Dinner.  As is the custom, we had a charity auction at dinner,
in this case to raise money for the <a href="http://www.tassiedevil.com.au/">Save The Tasmanian Devil foundation</a>.
Part-way through the bidding process, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bdale_Garbee">Bdale Garbee</a> made a commitment
to shave his beard if the money raised was more than a certain
amount.  While I wasn't able to keep track of all the pledges and contributions, the result was a final amount of money raised that approached
the $40,000 AUD mark, and Bdale lost his beard.

<b>Memoirs of an OSCON Rockstar, Day 5</b>
<br>
This entry is about six months late.  The other entries I had written
on my flight back to Australia, whereas this one is being written back
on the ground.  It seems that the ground provides a great many distractions
and demands.
<p>
Friday was by far the most memorable day of OSCON 2008.  Firstly, I managed
to complete one of my lifetime goals of giving a plenary at OSCON.  Not only
did I have the entire OSCON audience to myself (which was <i>thousands</i>
of people), I was also giving the last talk for the entire conference,
and (at least for the conferences I go to), everyone expects the last
talk to be really good.
<p>
At this point I'm going to reveal one of the strange paradoxes of
public speaking.  The bigger your audience, and the higher their
expectations, <i>the easier it is</i>.  There's a whole bunch of
mental mechanic reasons why this is the case, but they're so long
they deserve a blog post of their own.
<p>
Before the talk I remember Edd being wonderful and finding me some food.
While I had spent lots of time on talk preparations, I'd forgotten to
find anything to eat during that time.  Thanks Edd!
<p>
The whole talk went smashingly well.  Everyone laughed at my jokes,
even the really cheesy ones.  I think it's sufficient to say it was
my most successful presentation ever.
<p>
After the talk I found the Perl crowd I'd been spending time with, and
went out for some very nice (and very cheap!) Vietnamese.  Skud suggested
I get a basil-seed drink, which was amazing, and I really need to put
my photo on-line to show it off properly.  Tim Bunce, hero of DBI and
NYTProf, passed his iPhone around the tables and collected everyone's
contact details.  If you need to contact anyone in the Perl world,
there's a good chance you can do so using Tim's phone.
<p>
Having finished our meal, there Perl crowd seemed to disperse.  Some
went home, I think some went to the Portland Beer Festival, and I
joined the group that went off to Powell's book store.  After a fun
time looking at books, I returned to Powell's cafe, where we generally
decided was our centrla meeting point.  I'd picked up a book on
the cultivation of wild fungi, and immediately made friends with
Stacy, a friend of Schwern's and a local to Portland, who was also
a mushroom hunter.  Apparently Portland has big crops of Chanterelles
each year, of which I'm intensely jealous.
<p>
At some point I get invited to a BBQ, and I secretly cheer inside, because
it would have been rather sad if I gave a massively successful talk in
front of thousands of people and didn't get invited to anything.  I
heartily accept.
<p>
There are some street-car (tram) trips, and Schwern offers me the loan
of a bike to get to the BBQ.  Having not had a chance to cycle anywhere
all week, I think this sounds like a fantastic way to get around.  Stacy
was kind enough to volunteer as a guide to get me to the BBQ.  I'm very
happy for this, because every time I turn a corner by myself I drift
onto the left hand side of the road, which is a great place for cyclists
to be in Australia, but definitely not a good place in America.
<p>
On the way to the BBQ we drop off at a store to buy some provisions to
take along.  Stacy introduces me to some delicious local cherries, and
then hits me with one of the most awkward moments of my entire trip:
"We should bring some wine to the party.  Since you're Australian,
can you pick out a nice Australian wine?"
<p>
As the cool international speaker, I don't know how to admit that I
actually know nothing about Australian wines.  Yes, I'm a great consumer
of them, but I have a huge circle of Australian friends who know their
wines <i>much</i> better than me, and I usually just take their advice.
Of the good wines that I <i>do</i> know, none of them are at the store,
so I kind of pick something at random.
<p>
With cherries and wine acquired, we continue onto the BBQ, where I
experience what is the singularly greatest moment I have ever had as
a conference speaker.  When I arrive, the host of the party, Lindsey 
(who I previously hadn't met), is <i>actively reciting part of my talk</i>.
I remember just standing there with a huge grin on my face until I'm
eventually introduced, when I discover that Lindsey is an awesomely
cool person, and one of the reasons for the BBQ is because Lindsey
is leaving Portland to continue her studies of Computer Science
(to the doctorate level, IIRC).  And then the best part of the
night happens, which fulfils a <i>second</i> lifetime goal...
<p>
I get to play Rock Band.  In a real basement.  On a <i>huge</i> projection
screen.  For bonus points, we even have Adam Kennedy on drums.
<p>
As strange as it sounds, playing <i>Rock Band</i> was one of my goals
for the trip, and I'd previously been mourning the fact that I didn't
have the luggage space to bring a copy home with me.  (The full game
includes two guitars and a drum set, and my suitcase was rather full.)
<p>
Lindsey's party was fantastic, and special shout-outs go to Kate and
Jeff, both of whom I spent much time talking to.  The saddest part
was it coming to a close, and me having heard the (now confirmed)
rumours that OSCON will be moving to San Jose for 2009.  It sucks having
made so many wonderful friends in Portland and not being able to come
back to Portland next year for OSCON, although I hope to find
other excuses to return.
<p>
At the end of the party Schwern is kind enough to give me a lift back
to my hotel.  The next day I sleep in, spend a little time sight-seeing,
and fly back to Australia.  My feet are sore, but I really don't want to
leave.
<p>
Lindsey, Kate, Stacy, Skud, Eric, Ricardo, Allison, Edd, Gina,
Tim, Jos, Andy, Matt, Perigrin, Jeff, r0ml, (and anyone I've missed),
and especially Shirley (our fantastic OSCON speaker liason), and
Schwern (who showed me around, let me borrow his bike, and generally
allowed me crash into his social circle), thank-you all
for a wonderful time, and an unforgettable trip.  I hope to see you
all again at OSCON 2009!

My talk is on Friday, 5th December, at 11:30am.

                <p><b>perl589delta needs your help!</b><br>
I've volunteered to write the release notes for the upcoming 5.8.9 release of Perl.  However I rapidly discovered there's an awful lot of changes that need to be examined and distilled into the final document that will become perl589delta.pod.
<p>
Luckily, this is a task that's easily broken into chunks and run in
parallel, and I've done exactly that.  I've got a copy of all the changes
that have gone into the 5.8 branch since 5.8.8 was released, and I've
chunked it by month.  Some months are quiet, with not many changes, and some
months are very busy, with lots of changes.
<p>
I'm making a call out to the Perl community to volunteer to help with the
writing of the release notes.  You don't need to be familiar with Perl's
guts to do this; if you don't understand a change we'll have a "too hard"
bucket that things can be thrown into, and someone (who may be me) will
figure them out.  Likewise, you don't need a lot of time; I'm not expecting
everyone who volunteers for a chunk of work to finish the entire chunk, just
as long as you work on it sequentially and let us know where you're up to,
you can put it down at any time.
<p>
Contributing to the perl589delta project directly helps with the release of
Perl 5.8.9.  However you'll also get a mention in the prestigious Perl
authors file, which looks totally awesome on your resume, and gives you
super bragging rights.  If you're on <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/">ohloh</a>, you'll get kudos from me, and commit points from the project.  Your work will almost certainly give you enough material for a 5-minute "What's new in my bit of Perl 5.8.9" lightning talk, which will make you incredibly popular at conferences and user-groups.
<p>
In order to get started, just follow the instructions in the README file at
the bottom of our <a href="http://github.com/pfenwick/perl589delta/">source control repository page</a> and sign up to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl589delta/">discussion list</a>.
<p>
Feel free to track the repository or sign up the list even if you're not
sure if you want to contribute, and are just curious about how all this
works.  We're happy to have the company!
<p>
If you have any questions, or would like to volunteer, you can e-mail me at <a href="mailto:pjf@cpan.org">pjf@cpan.org</a>, mail the perl589delta team at
<a href="mailto:perl589delta@googlegroups.com">perl589delta@googlegroups.com</a>, or simply post a comment on this journal if you're reading it on <a href="http://use.perl.org/">use.perl.org</a>.
