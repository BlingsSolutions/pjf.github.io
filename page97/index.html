            <B>Strange Fruit</b><BR>
One of the trees in our yard is a <i>Medlar</i> tree, which
is of European descent.  It's hardy, attractive and frost
tolerant.  Despite our tree having been planted less than a
year ago, it's provided us with a good harvest of fruit for
its size, despite the dry summer.  To add to the tree's
praises, it's one of the few fruits which are in season
during winter, with the fruit just reaching the ripe stage
now.  Despite all this, medlar fruit are rarely available
commercially.
<p>
Having had my first experience with this fruit recently,
it's not surprising to see why.  the fruit are about half
the size of my thumb.  While still immature, they're hard,
orange-to-red, and taste something between pear and apple. 
However, while the immature fruit are nice, they're only
slightly less hard than granite.  The "mature" fruit are
quite a different experience.  One day, your lovely reddish
fruit will have turned both the colour and consistancy of
rotten apple.  This fermentation caused by natural yeasts
transforms the hard, inedible fruit into a sweet, soft,
squishy delicacy.  It tastes something akin to unsweetened
apple sauce.
<p>
Picking and transporting the immature fruit would be a
breeze, but convincing the public that something which has
self-fermented is good to eat is another matter.  Eating my
first medlar was quite a leap of faith, all my previous
experiences in puting brown squishy fruit into my mouth have
been bad.
<p>
I'm looking forward to next winter, when I'm sure we'll have
a larger crop and will be able to share this unique
experience with more friends.
<p>
<b>Pasta</b><br>
Purchased an inexpensive pasta-maker and have been eating
freshly made pasta for probably two-thirds of all meals
since.  Making pasta is quite simple, doesn't take much
time, and tastes fantastic.  Mind you, using five eggs per
500g of flour makes me happy that we've got chickens,
although with the short days they've dropped to laying only
3-4 eggs/day.
<p>
The pasta-maker, while having a lifetime guarantee, has
already broken the clamp which is used to affix it to the
table-top.  With a molded-plastic handle, I'm not at all
surprised that it didn't last long.  I'll be returning to
the shop in the next few days along with receipt, guarantee,
and poorly made clamp in hand.

            <b>The joys of hardware</b><br>
I've been hearing an odd sound in the office the last couple
of days. At first I thought it was the scanner, but it
continued to persist after the scanner had been turned off.
<p>
This morning, Jacinta remarked that she could distinctly
smell the odour of frying silicon.  That filled me with
dread, having already had two power supplies and a
hard-drive die in our main server over the last few years.
<p>
It ended up the problem was a CPU fan that was on the verge
of dying.  The smell was caused by dust that had burnt on
the heat-sink after the fan had stopped working.  An easy
enough job of swapping in a new CPU/fan.  The old CPU works,
but I don't have a replacement fan for it, and don't really
have a use for it otherwise.

After almost of month of calling data recovery houses, 
searching on ebay, negotiating with second hand merchants 
from overseas, and general waiting for the post, my 
replacement drive arrived today.
<P>
Popped the new drive into my machine, formatted it, ran a 
few tests.  Yup, it works.
<P>
Pulled it out, swapped the dead controller on my old drive 
with the controller from the new drive.  Plugged it in, 
booted, ran fdisk.  Oh my goodness, the partition table in 
intact.  I'm so lucky.
<p>
Mount the drive.  Wow, the superblock is still intact.  
Read the data from the drive.  That's all there too.
<p>
Managed to recover every single file on the toasted drive.  
Very very very happy Paul.  Cost, about $AU100 vs $AU1000 
for professional data recovery.
<p>
Moral of the story: Keep backups of your junk drives.  Just 
because you wouldn't put anything of value on your squid 
cache drive, doesn't mean that you won't (in a moment of 
stupidity) decide it's a good place to store your six years 
worth of mail archives.
<p>
<B>Other News</b><BR>
I have a great new way of making money using my computer 
and the internet!  I can work from home, set my own hours, 
and earn TAX-FREE income.  Yes, it really does work!
<p>
No, I'm not going to tell you what it is.  If everyone was 
doing it, then I wouldn't be able to make anywhere near as 
much.

            <B>Massive Filesystem Corruption</b><BR>
At about 10am this morning, the power supply on the main
server failed.  This has happened once before, and to be
honest the novelty of fitting a not-quite-the-same power
supply into the case was wearing a bit thin.  I did it
nonetheless, using an old supply from a 386 that had been
hanging around just waiting to be made useful again.
<p>
With the new power-supply in place, it was discovered that
only two of the three disks were responding.  Hmm, very odd.
 Locate faulty disk, remove, check over...
<p>
Oh my.  Chips on the drive controller aren't supposed to
bubble like that, are they?  And boy does it smell bad! 
That's okay, that drive was just /var, and I can live
without my log files and proxy cache.  After all, that's why
I've made backups of the other two disks but not this one.
<p>
Except that /var contains the all-important /var/spool/mail,
/var/cvs, Debian package information, and some databases.  A
bit of an ouch there.
<p>
It was only later that I discovered that I had my last six
years worth of mail also on said hard-drive, since it had
more space than the other disks.  That was the crushing blow.
<p>
As it happens, the blowing power-supply also managed to
cause damage to the motherboard/CPU/RAM as well, since init
would segfault upon startup.  Changing the Mobo/CPU/RAM
fixed the problem.  I'll be testing sticks of memory to see
which ones can be recovered.
<p>
Moral of the story, backup everything, even the stuff you
don't care about, in case there's some stuff you do care
about in there as well.
<p>
It looks like the drive's controller is dead, but the
platters and mechanism inside are still okay.  Tried
replacing the controller with a similar model from a drive
that has busted insides, but to no avail.  It *tries* to
spin the drive up and all, but is obviously expecting
something else.  I think if I can find an identical
controller (old-ish Qantum fireball) I should be fine.  I'm
hoping that one of these professional data recovery joints
has a big box of them.

RIP Boor'yall.  She dropped off the perch (quite literally)
Saturday morning.
<p>
<B>Karaoke</b><BR>
Once again I'm amazed by some of the things that exist in
the world.  On Friday myself and some friends were looking
for a Karaoke bar in order to do a bit of singing.  We found
one promising looking place and entered.  The group had a
couple of Japanese exchange students in it, so we wanted to
find a bar that had a good multilingual selection.  This
place <i>looked</i> like it should.
<p>
Upon entering, I was very politely informed that this is the
sort of bar which has "ladies to sit with you, and since you
have your own ladies, there wouldn't be much point...", and
"yes, it is a karaoke bar, but more of a <i>gentleman's
club</i> karaoke bar".
<p>
We didn't stay, but we did spend a fair bit of time
disbelieving the bar and wondering if it really was true.
<p>
<b>Toy</b><br>
My palm m505 arrived the other day.  It's been very handy in
planning and prioritizing.  It's also shown me that I'm much
much more busy than I thought I was previously.
