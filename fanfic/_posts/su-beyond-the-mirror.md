My name is Lapis Lazuli. I am a Gem, and I wish to apologise to the people of Earth.

Many of you will remember the day the ocean disappeared, an event many have rightly called the worst environmental disaster in living memory. It was my fault, and I take full responsibility. I write this now not to ask forgiveness, but to provide an explanation of our culture and psychology, with the hope that it may avert a simlilar diaster in the future.

Gems aren't born, we're made. We're manufacured. There's a lot of speculation about us and our technology, but we're one and the same. Every gemship, and every artefact, is a Gem, like myself. It's true that I was once a historical database, before my current form.

We aren't created like the biological systems of Earth. A new gem doesn't have emotions, or thought, or self-awareness. It's capable of all these things, along with the ability to perform vast calculations, and to make use of physical laws that human scientists are only just beginning to discover. Most of us are fashioned into technology soon after we're created.

This is not cruel, as human scholars have sometimes suggested. A gem that exists as a ship—or as a knowledge device—does not have awareness, nor did it ever have awareness. The few of my kind who have awareness and free-will are rare these days, but we neither envy nor pity our sisters that are the bulk of the devices we use.
