				<title>The iOS SSL/TLS bug is worse than you think</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Holy smokes. So having looked at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/02/22/applebug.html&quot;&gt;actual code&lt;/a&gt; for this, the bug in iOS / OSX is &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; worse than described &lt;a href=&quot;http://gizmodo.com/why-apples-huge-security-flaw-is-so-scary-1529041062&quot;&gt;on gizmodo&lt;/a&gt;. The article is misleading when it says your home network is safe, it’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;. If I poison your DNS queries, compromise your home router (they’re &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; exploitable), have privileged access to the network infrastructure between you and what you’re connecting to, or all manner of other things, then I &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; your connection, and whatever data you send across it; credit card details, bank account logins, facebook passwords, all of it. If I hijack anything that’s doing a software update, then I may potentially own your device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, if you’re already logged into a website, I may even be able to steal your cookies and act as you without you even needing to enter a username and password at all. Seriously, this exploit really is about as bad as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two-factor auth will mitigate some, but not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the damage here. The only way to close this hole is to upgrade your vulnerable apple devices now. Please do this. Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How I Claimed $270 of Beeminder Bounties</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Last Tuesday I paid &lt;a href=&quot;https://beeminder.com&quot; title=&quot;Quantify your goals with Beeminder&quot;&gt;Beeminder&lt;/a&gt; $5 because I didn’t floss my teeth when I promised that I would. That evening, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; was the one collecting $270 from Beeminder…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you’re not familiar with me, I’m outstandingly lazy. I really dislike &lt;em&gt;having&lt;/em&gt; to do anything at all. I’m totally fine with &lt;em&gt;choosing&lt;/em&gt; to do things, but I push back pretty hard against the universe when something &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to be done. This is why I’m so big on automation, it reduces the things to have to be done by me, and allows me to practice &lt;em&gt;efficient laziness&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are some things one simply can’t automate; flossing your teeth, running a business, doing one’s taxes, getting some exercise. While I might be able to write digital agents that can &lt;em&gt;assist&lt;/em&gt; me with those tasks, fundamentally they’re things that I have to do. The problem is, left to my own devices, I rarely will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is one time when I’ll take action, and that’s when presented with the threat of imminent failure. If you’ve read WBW’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html&quot;&gt;excellent article on procrastination&lt;/a&gt; then you’ll understand that the panic monster is one of the few things that will get chronic procrastinators to actually move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For tasks with big, looming deadlines such as &lt;a href=&quot;/talks&quot;&gt;my talks&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a very clear, and visceral threat of failure. They’re even worse than most deadlines, because they’re &lt;em&gt;public speaking&lt;/em&gt;, which is already flat out terrifying, and most of my talks are given in Australia, where everything is trying to kill you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, if I need to get something done, I’ll promise to present a talk on it, safe in the knowledge that the fear of public ridicule and the thought of my audience &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltwater_Crocodile&quot;&gt;taking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_fish&quot;&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_White_Shark&quot;&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_jellyfish&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_ringed_octopus&quot;&gt;beach&lt;/a&gt; will be enough to terrify me into action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet there’s a problem. Small things which I should be doing regularly, like flossing my teeth, or doing exercise, come with with no dramatic failure cliffs. And let’s face it, planning to live one’s life by only doing the most terrifying things at the last possible moment isn’t exactly the most optimal way to live. This is where Beeminder comes in handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://beeminder.com&quot; title=&quot;Quantify your goals with Beeminder&quot;&gt;Beeminder&lt;/a&gt; provides the ability to establish &lt;em&gt;commitment devices&lt;/em&gt;. In the same way that I’ll promise to give a talk on software I would &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to write, I can use Beeminder to promise to do something that I would &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to do, but which I know future me will be unlikely to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beeminder is exceptionally good at taking large or ongoing tasks, and splitting them into smaller, more achievable goals. It then draws the most friggin’ nerdtastic graphs ever, with rolling averages, goal lines, predictive curves, and all sorts of goodies, so you can see just how well you’re doing. The most important of these is the ‘yellow brick road’. If you’re on that, then you’re on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I might achieve my long-term task of good dental hygiene by having a goal to floss three times each week. Or I might turn my goal of writing a 5,000 word essay into the task of writing 250 words per day for 20 days. Beeminder makes it very easy to see if I’m achieving my goal, or if I’m at risk of falling behind. And if I over-perform (maybe by writing 1000 words one day), then Beeminder will cut me some slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the real power of Beeminder is that you can pledge an amount of money against your goal. Promising that I’m going to floss my teeth thrice weekly may not be very motivating, but knowing that I’ll lose $5 if I don’t make my flossing deadline is enough to have me stumble into the bathroom before bed, rather than promising to myself that I will do it later. And while I can change my goals at any time, I have to do it at least a week in advance, so I can’t weasel out of something just because I don’t want to do it right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I pay out on the occasional pledge, those amounts have been absolutely worth it. Overall I’m paying about $0.20/week for good dental health, and maybe $0.08/day to keep my inbox under control. A Beeminder pledge has also kept me attending my last 30 dance lessons, by giving me just enough of a nudge to not come up with excuses as to why I’m too busy to go, and I’ve not paid a penny to Beeminder for that goal, as I’ve never got behind in my dance lessons when I’ve promised to be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of cool &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.beeminder.com/akrasia/&quot;&gt;cognitive science behind Beeminder&lt;/a&gt;, but one of the neat things is they’re &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; committed to using their own system to ensure that important tasks like user-visible improvements, blog-posts, and general support get done. And by very committed, I mean that the Beeminder team &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.beeminder.com/blogdog/&quot;&gt;will pay out pledges&lt;/a&gt; to users that call them out if they fall behind on one of their goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s what happened last Tuesday. One of the founders hadn’t spent enough hours on Beeminder that week, and I ended up $270 richer as a result, and that was one of the smaller pledges they have on the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, being me, I don’t want to feel I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to check if any bounties are payable, so I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pjf/exobrain/blob/master/bin/source/beeminder-bounties&quot;&gt;written some code&lt;/a&gt; to check for me. I’ve got no qualms about being efficiently lazy when it comes to motivating others. ;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Is social media making us antisocial?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed a concerning trend over the last few years, and I’m not exactly sure what to do about it. As a culture, our communication habits are changing, and the results may be terrible for our mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a long post, and it’s going to help if we start with a brief review of communication over the ages, beginning with face-to-face interactions. These provide plenty of &lt;em&gt;non-verbal&lt;/em&gt; signals, such as body language and vocal tone. It’s often clear when interacting with someone if they’re paying attention or distracted; if they’re angry, joking, happy, or just bored. (Although even face-to-face, we’re still good at &lt;a href=&quot;http://not-a-jerk.blogspot.com/2012/03/fighting-for-no-reasonhow-were-hard.html&quot; title=&quot;Fighting for no reason, how we're hard-hired to be hostile&quot;&gt;getting things wrong&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point we learned how to read and write, and while letters were an important stage in our development, I’m restricting myself to looking at direct and instantaneous communication in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skip forward a few thousand years to the telephone. This technology was game-changing. It allowed people to talk, even when separated by distance. While it wasn’t possible to read body language over the telephone, one could still read vocal tone. Telephones were a fixture in people’s homes, so you generally knew you had someone’s full attention when you were talking to them, and it became rapidly apparent when you did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the advent of computers, things became more interesting, and definitely more diverse. were find ourselves with IRC, chatrooms, SMS, instant messenger, and a variety of other text-based communication forms. These provided fewer non-verbal signals (emoticons are a notable exception here), along with less clues for when someone was distracted with other things or not. But still, one used these forms of communication to maintain a conversation with an individual, or a directed group of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='pullquote'&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;i class='fa fa-quote-left fa-2x pull-left'&gt; &lt;/i&gt; The dominant mode of communication with social media is 'post-and-hope'.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now we’re seeing a form of communication which is radically different from what we’ve experienced in the past: social media. The dominant mode of communication with social media is the &lt;em&gt;undirected broadcast&lt;/em&gt;, what I call “post-and-hope”. You post on your wall, or tweet to the world, and people may respond, or they may not. When they do respond, the responses are more ephemeral. It’s harder to have a personal conversation when all six-hundred of your friends are watching it, or you’re limited to 140 characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media doesn’t preclude more directed conversations, but it is shifting the ways in which we’re communicating. Combined with the rapid uptake of mobile electronics, where a friend being ‘online’ may simply mean they’ve opened their phone for a few seconds in an elevator, there’s even more uncertainty associated with directed conversations than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is that for many people, a significant amount of communication is broadcasted, rather than directed, and the continuity of a conversation is more unpredictable, and more likely to evaporate without a clear verbal or textual signal (such as “catch you later”), than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class='right'&gt;&lt;a class='fancybox' href='/images/personal/depression-instant-messaging.png' rel='group'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/personal/depression-instant-messaging.png' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;For adolescents who perceive themselves to have low friendship quality (the top line), instant messaging is significantly protective to mental health¹.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m aware that “all this technology is making us antisocial” is hardly a new sentiment. My parents expressed concern about me hanging out on bulletin boards with ‘electronic people’ as a teenager, even though I viewed that as exceptionally good for my social and intellectual development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the scientific literature shows that spending time on instant messenger is &lt;em&gt;protective&lt;/em&gt; of mental health if one is feeling socially isolated¹, studies into social media itself seem to be less clear, and I’m still trying to make sense of them. I’ve included references at the bottom of the article, in case you wish to do some reading yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However this is a personal post, and one thing I’m concerned about is the trends in my own social habits. I communicate with many more people than I used to, but I’m much less close to any of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='pullquote'&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;i class='fa fa-quote-left fa-2x pull-left'&gt; &lt;/i&gt; I communicate with many more people, but I'm less close to any of them.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go back five years ago, and I have a small number of close friends whom I felt very comfortable talking to, and we would share our experiences and thoughts extensively. While we weren’t in constant contact, it was very reassuring to know they existed, and I took for granted that if I was worried or anxious, or wanted to share news of a success or receive guidance on some defeat, that I’d have close friends to fall back on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, things feel different. My close friends are still my friends, but communicate with them less. When I do communicate, the conversations are more shallow. I’ve noticed that’s often &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; fault; I’m less likely to have an on-line conversation as a dedicated activity, and they seem to more often start as side-effects from other social media use, and dry up just as quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class='right'&gt;&lt;a class='fancybox' href='/images/personal/support-and-depression.png' rel='group'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/personal/support-and-depression.png' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Social support is protective against depression²&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That worries me, not just from a social standpoint, but also from a mental health one. We know that having a confidant—someone with whom one feels they can talk to about anything—is hugely protective to one’s mental health. If social media &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; making us less close, then we run the risk of many more people suffering from mental health issues due to that isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure part of the reason for these changes is the sheer number of people with whom I interact with on-line. If you were to go back a decade ago, I had &lt;em&gt;dozens&lt;/em&gt; of people in my instant messenger contact list. Today, my Facebook friends number in the &lt;em&gt;hundreds&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t yet have enough evidence to say that this is becoming an issue for society in general, but I’m concerned that it might be. There’s a number of studies showing links between social media usage and depression, but these don’t show &lt;em&gt;causality&lt;/em&gt;; people feeling isolated may be using social media more as a means of support. That’s certainly something I’ve done in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s just as concerning for me—if not more so—is that that systems like Facebook are increasingly taking the choice of which stories to display on one’s feed out of the user’s control, and are instead selecting what they feel will provide you with the best ‘personalized feed’. That’s generally understood to be whatever causes you to continue to interact with Facebook, since that means you’ll view the most ads. However it opens the possibly of &lt;em&gt;algorithmic isolation&lt;/em&gt;, simply because your important posts may not be shown to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is particularly notable for burying posts where the author expresses that they’re sad or unhappy. That’s not a deliberate decision on Facebook’s behalf, but nobody ‘likes’ their friend being unhappy, and many people don’t know what to say in the comments. To Facebook, a sad post looks like a boring post, because nobody’s interacting with it. I’ve found that adding “Likes=Hugs” to the top of my writing is sometimes enough to overcome this, but it’s rare that a post about one feeling sad can compete with a picture of a cat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, it seems that every new form of communication is heralded as being bad for our mental health soon after it’s introduced, and often those fears end up being unfounded. Social media and its associated modes of communication are still very young, and while they’re an active topic of study, it may still be some time until we truly understand their impact on society and individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Bag Trashed By Airport Staff</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I travelled from Melbourne to Portland (Oregon), a trip that I have done many, many times before. And like many times before, it was clear that my checked luggage had been ‘inspected’. But I’d never had it inspected like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally one is informed of a bag inspection because there’s a note from the TSA saying that one’s bag had been opened and inspected. In the past, this has been the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; way I’d known my bag was inspected, because usually the contents had been nicely replaced the way they had been found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve begun to start packing an ‘arrival bag’ in my checked luggage, which is everything I expect that I’ll need once I land after twenty-something hours of travel with extreme jet-lag. It has a couple of changes of clothes, toiletries, pajamas, chargers, a book or two, and anything else I think I might need in the first couple of days after arrival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when I opened my bag upon arriving in Portland, everything in my arrival bag had been removed, and was strewn around my suitcase. My spare shoes had been removed from their plastic bag, so they could sully my other clothes. My books, underwear, and shirts were floating freely. My cables were out and tangled with the rest of my possessions..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My socks had been unpaired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of them&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who the hell unpairs socks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s the thing, I don’t know. This &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; come with a note from the TSA, although if I were leaving someone else’s possessions in that state, I wouldn’t leave a note either. I didn’t inspect my bag between arriving in LAX and continuing on to Portland, so I don’t know if it was rummaged through before or after I entered the USA. Combined with discovering that one &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2012/02/australian-airports-to-get-compulsory-body-scans/&quot;&gt;can’t opt out of body-scanners in Australia&lt;/a&gt; I’m feeling that air travel comes with an even greater violation of privacy than I had previously come to expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, nothing had gone missing, but to be honest I don’t keep a manifest of my possessions when travelling. Then again I’m not usually worried about airport staff stealing things, or trashing the contents of my bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should be…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Beeminder users, Exobrain also supports call-backs. This means you can chain events off anything that Beeminder can measure, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.withings.com/en/scales/&quot;&gt;Withings&lt;/a&gt; scales, &lt;a href=&quot;http://runkeeper.com/&quot;&gt;Runkeeper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fitbit.com/&quot;&gt;fitbit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/&quot;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rescuetime.com/&quot;&gt;RescueTime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.duolingo.com/&quot;&gt;duolingo&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a quantified-selfer, you can automatically record your activities to your log. If you need some extra motivation, you can automatically gain experience points on &lt;a href=&quot;https://habitrpg.com/&quot;&gt;HabitRPG&lt;/a&gt; for achieving your goals. You can back-up all of your activity from third-party websites in real-time, or even allow people to add to your TODO list by tweeting at you with a &lt;code&gt;#todo&lt;/code&gt; tag!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you own a &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpebble.com/&quot;&gt;Pebble watch&lt;/a&gt; and are a Pushover user, then you can send notifications directly to your watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use pre-written Exobrain actions or you can write your own. Exobrain is completely free, open source, and extensible. Because it uses a shared message bus, you can even update components on the fly, without having to restart the whole system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exobrain is written in Perl and at its core uses an extensible, language-independent, messaging format based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://zeromq.org/&quot;&gt;0MQ&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.json.org/&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing extensions for Exobrain is easy; here’s the entire code to send all tweets that mention you to your preferred notify service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='highlight'&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class='perl'&gt;    &lt;span class='c1'&gt;#!/usr/bin/env perl&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class='k'&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='n'&gt;Exobrain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class='nv'&gt;$exobrain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='o'&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='n'&gt;watch_loop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class='n'&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class='o'&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='s'&gt;&amp;#39;Measurement::Tweet&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class='n'&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='o'&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='k'&gt;sub &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='nv'&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='o'&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='n'&gt;to_me&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='p'&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class='k'&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class='o'&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='k'&gt;sub &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class='nv'&gt;$exobrain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='o'&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='n'&gt;notify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='nv'&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='o'&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='n'&gt;summary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='p'&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class='p'&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class='p'&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exobrain is very much a work-in-progress, and we would love your contributions and feedback.

				<title>Remembering Aaron Swartz</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a little over a year since Aaron Swartz passed by taking his own life. Aaron was a hero of the Internet. He believed strongly in freedom and privacy. He was instrumental in helping retain freedom and privacy on the Internet. He fought for civil liberties and social justice. He made the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that for many people, the thought of mass surveillance, of warrantless wiretapping, seems abstract and remote. That’s one of the reasons why it’s so insidious; by its very nature we don’t see it happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following video is part of a campaign that I believe strongly about. Whether you choose to participate, or learn more, is entirely up to you. But the video itself is a beautiful testament to Aaron’s life, and changes for good that he made in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Paul&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Tolerance, not bigotry, now maximises shareholder value</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Coca-Cola showed an advertisement as part of the superbowl coverage. It featured Americans doing American things; except those Americans were racially diverse, and the song—America The Beautiful—was sung in multiple languages other than English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a big deal on the Internet right now about the bigotry and hatred which this advertisement has revealed. Of course Coke knew this would happen, and yet they screened the advertisement anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is simple. As a society, we’re becoming &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; tolerant every year, and Coca-Cola knows that. It’s firmly directing its ad towards the growing and more ethical population who believes that diversity and tolerance are good, rather than the shrinking percentage of people who do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We, as a society, are getting better. Yes, you can pick apart Coke’s motives here, but the fact remains that we’re now in a society where promoting diversity and tolerance are seen as winning strategies. That’s not something we would have seen fifty years ago, and I doubt it’s even something we would have seen ten years back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still have a long way to go, but we’re getting there. Thank you, humanity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>One Thing Can Make The World A Better Place</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Many people have the dream of being a successful writer. There’s an allure with having one’s work read by others, but the business of writing has changed. One no longer seeks a publisher, but instead traffic and results on search engines. One no longer expects royalties, instead revenue is generated from advertisements and affiliate links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The language of the web is now monetization. If that were my goal there’d be advertisements on this website. But there are none. At least, not in the form you’d expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;figure class='right smaller'&gt;&lt;a class='fancybox' href='/images/ethics/toilet-cat.jpg' rel='group'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/ethics/toilet-cat.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Smiling at a cat still brings good to the world.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s commonplace at to prompt the reader to stick around at the end of one’s article. But my goal isn’t to have others read my writing, that’s merely a means to an end. My goal is to &lt;em&gt;make the world a better place&lt;/em&gt;, and I hope to co-opt my readers into helping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at the end of every article, I’d like to direct the reader to whatever will bring the greatest good. That could be something as simple as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKffm2uI4dk&quot;&gt;funny cat video&lt;/a&gt;; after all, making people smile &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; bringing good to the world. But I think we can do better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presently, I’m encouraging people to read &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/1bABN6P&quot;&gt;3 myths that block progress for the poor&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a class='social-link' href='https://twitter.com/Quintrino'&gt;@Quintrino&lt;/a&gt; brought it to my attention. It’s an incredible piece; well-written and researched. If you have the time, I strongly encourage you to read and share it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However my most popular article has to do with how &lt;a href=&quot;/ethics/2014/01/25/how-to-screw-learning-with-one-simple-belief.html&quot;&gt;beliefs can influence learning&lt;/a&gt;, with over 35,000 hits in the last five days. I have evidence that it’s particularly popular with parents, so at this very moment time &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are my target audience. However I’m interested in &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; suggestions as to what I can encourage readers to do next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that one thing &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; know which will make the world a better place… what is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please scroll down and add your suggestion in the comments below; you can be anonymous if you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>I have a favour to ask.</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear everyone, I have a favour to ask…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine the future. Not as it is next week, next year, or even in a hundred years hence. Imagine the future as it exists in &lt;em&gt;ten thousand&lt;/em&gt; years time; and imagine that’s a future where things have gone &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a dystopia; humanity has gone beyond its roots and has colonised the stars. We’ve outgrown our humble beginnings, we’ve overcome the flaws in our brain: anger, jealousy, selfishness; but we’ve kept the things which are important. We have compassion, and foresight. We have understanding, and ethics. I want you to imagine the &lt;em&gt;best possible future&lt;/em&gt; that you can; one that’s not just best for humanity, but also best for any being that may be able to think or feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a big leap of imagination, but I want you to try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I want you to do something in the next 24 hours—purposefully and consciously, regardless of how big or small—which would make our future selves &lt;em&gt;proud&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can share that here if you like. You can keep it to yourself. It can be a tiny tiny thing, or it can be the crowning achievement of your existence. But it’s human nature to think about the here-and-now, and I so dearly, dearly wish we’d spend more time working towards how things &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>How to learn everything, without spending any time</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;What if I told you there’s an app which runs on all your devices, is free, has strong evidence-based support for its effectiveness, and allows you to acquire large amounts of knowledge and &lt;em&gt;retain it indefinitely&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if I told you it wasn’t even going to take any time out of your day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;figure class='right'&gt;&lt;a class='fancybox' href='/images/tech/anki.png' rel='group'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/tech/anki.png' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Anki: It's like having cheat-codes for knowledge.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two amazing tools which I use during those odd chunks of time. The first &lt;a href=&quot;http://pjf.id.au/tech/2014/01/23/dont-read-articles--listen-to-them.html&quot; title=&quot;Don't read articles, listen to them (pjf.id.au)&quot;&gt;reads me articles I’ve saved&lt;/a&gt;, and requires only that I have headphones. The second is &lt;a href=&quot;http://ankisrs.net/&quot; title=&quot;Anki: Powerful, intelligent flashcards&quot;&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s like having cheat-codes for knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anki is a flash-card system that employs &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect&quot; title=&quot;Spacing Effect (Wikipedia)&quot;&gt;spaced repetition&lt;/a&gt;, which exploits our understanding of human memory to allow you to obtain a large amount of knowledge, and then &lt;em&gt;retain that knowledge indefinitely&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know from research that we remember things most &lt;em&gt;efficiently&lt;/em&gt; when we’re tested infrequently over a longer time span. If you’ve ever crammed for an exam, you’ve probably discovered you’ve lost that knowledge a week or two later. Anki and spaced repetition gives us &lt;em&gt;anti-cramming&lt;/em&gt;, letting you do a minimum of work to memorize information over a long period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The working behind spaced repetition is simple. As long as you’re able to keep remembering, the time between successive tests gradually increases. New knowledge may be tested multiple times per week, but things you know really well will may come up every couple of years. The idea is to get you to recall knowledge just before you’re about to forget it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provided you practice regularly, it’s possible to learn and retain a tremendous amount of information. Regular practice sounds like it’s going to be hard, but I’ve discovered it’s actually the easiest part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My day is full of odd bits of time that aren’t typically useful. Waiting for a tram, for my coffee to brew, standing in line at the airport. These chunks aren’t long enough to do much with, but they’re &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; for Anki cards. Each card takes only a few seconds, and if you reach your learning goals for the day there are always options to review ahead. Because you’re recycling time that would otherwise be wasted, using Anki comes with practically no opportunity costs whatsoever!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Anki phone app comes with the ability to configure notifications if you have cards due. &lt;em&gt;Switch that on&lt;/em&gt;. Simply having an icon on your toolbar provides a reminder you’ve got cards to complete, and can help act as a visual cue for whenever you open up your phone and wonder what you were meant to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anki lets you make your own decks in the desktop client. I have decks for words I frequently misspell, dietary intolerances of my friends, people I’ve met, &lt;a href=&quot;https://coursera.org/&quot; title=&quot;Coursera: Take free online classes from 80+ top universities and organisations&quot;&gt;subjects I’ve learning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://duolingo.com/&quot; title=&quot;Duolingo: Learn languages for free&quot;&gt;languages&lt;/a&gt;, and anything else that I know I’ll easily forget. However Anki also has a rich number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/&quot; title=&quot;Anki Shared Decks&quot;&gt;shared decks&lt;/a&gt;. For me personally, both &lt;a href=&quot;https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/970971960&quot;&gt;cognitive biases&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1530243698&quot;&gt;hiragana/katakana&lt;/a&gt; (Japanese characters) feature heavily in my learning schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anki has clients for Windows, Mac, Linux/BSD, iOS, and Android; as well as a mobile-friendly web interface. While the iOS client requires payment, the others are free and open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are you waiting for? &lt;a href=&quot;http://ankisrs.net/&quot; title=&quot;Anki: Powerful, intelligent flashcards&quot;&gt;Download Anki&lt;/a&gt; and start learning!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
