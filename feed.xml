				<title>Use Markdown Instead Of BBCode With Vimperator</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I really love the Dwarf Fortress community, and a lot of it is centred around the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php&quot;&gt;bay12 forums&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, I don’t love BBCode (aka phpBB syntax), which is what the bay12 forums require me to write posts in. I’d much rather use &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax&quot;&gt;markdown&lt;/a&gt;. So I decided to fix that with the help of vimperator, and by writing my own markdown to BBcode parser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://metacpan.org/pod/Markdown::phpBB&quot;&gt;Markdown::phpBB&lt;/a&gt; module from the CPAN, you’ll find a nifty little program named &lt;code&gt;md2phpbb&lt;/code&gt;. This is a filter; it takes input in markdown, and emits output in BBcode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cpanm Markdown::phpBB     # install using cpanm
$ cpan  Markdown::phpBB     # install using classic cpan&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re editing in vim, you can run &lt;code&gt;:%!md2phpbb&lt;/code&gt; to replace your current buffer (written in markdown) with the equivalent text in BBcode. You can even bind it to a key, as I’ve done in my &lt;code&gt;~/.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;:nmap &amp;lt;F5&amp;gt; :%!md2phpbb&amp;lt;CR&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve installed md2phpbb into a user (rather than system) directory, then you may find that vimperator won’t have your perl-specific environment variables in place. In that case you can use full paths in your &lt;code&gt;~/.vimrc&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;:nmap &amp;lt;F5&amp;gt; :%!perl -I/home/pjf/perl5/lib/perl5 /home/pjf/perl5/bin/md2phpbb&amp;lt;CR&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vimperator.org/vimperator&quot;&gt;vimperator&lt;/a&gt; then you can already invoke vim from any textarea by pressing &lt;code&gt;ctrl-i&lt;/code&gt;. However BBcode websites usually bind this to &lt;em&gt;italics&lt;/em&gt;, so you’ll probably want to add an additional key for editing to your &lt;code&gt;~/.vimperatorrc&lt;/code&gt; file. I use &lt;code&gt;ctrl-e&lt;/code&gt;, for edit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;:inoremap &amp;lt;C-e&amp;gt; &amp;lt;C-i&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can use &lt;code&gt;ctrl-e&lt;/code&gt; to open a vim window, write your response in markdown, and then just hit &lt;code&gt;F5&lt;/code&gt; to turn it into BBCode. Best of all, the filter doesn’t change existing BBCode at all, so you can hit &lt;code&gt;F5&lt;/code&gt; as many times as you like, to refresh your text after edits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;md2phpbb&lt;/code&gt; and supporting libraries are completely free and open source, and can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pjf/Markdown-phpBB&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Personal: Depression—An Update</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In late 2012 I had a depressive episode. This is well documented; &lt;a href=&quot;2012-11-29-i-have-depression-an-open-letter-by-paul-fenwick.html&quot;&gt;I wrote about it on-line&lt;/a&gt;, and I even &lt;a href=&quot;http://pjf.id.au/talks/2013/07/24/depression-bugs-in-your-brain.html&quot;&gt;gave a talk at OSCON&lt;/a&gt;. My thought processes during that time were broken and cyclical; cognitively I knew that people were great, but emotionally I found myself intensely disliking them. As someone who’s long derived joy and energy from those around me, I seemed to spend all my energy arguing with the emotional part of myself that people &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; great… and yet it wouldn’t listen. The situation was exhausting, and I didn’t get anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I struck a deal. I would admit that perhaps people aren’t as great as I once thought, and that emotional monkey-brain would quieten down and let me think again. It worked, and I’d joke with my role-playing friends I recovered by taking a point in misanthropy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a good deal, because I knew that point in misanthropy could eventually be removed, and because &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; was better than being in the state I was back then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the misanthropy stuck around. It’s not as bad as it used to be, but it’s definitely there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have noticed me at less events in 2013, and part of that’s because the thought of seeing people has often been completely unappealing. Usually when I’m at an event, I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; social and happy, but the misanthropy often comes back as soon as I leave. Sometimes it comes back hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans have a knack of making up plausible excuses for our own behaviour, and then believing those excuses to be real¹. We have the same knack when it comes to emotions. We’ll look for things in our environment try to explain why we’re feeling a particular way, and believe they’re &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; the reason we feel that way².&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, when I’m feeling misanthropic, it’s hard for me to tell which thoughts of mine are actually legitimate, and which thoughts only &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; legitimate because of my emotional state. Often I’m appalled when I look back at some of my thoughts when I feel this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers of &lt;a href=&quot;http://hpmor.com/&quot;&gt;HPMOR&lt;/a&gt; will be familiar with assigning labels to the different viewpoints in one’s own head. When I’m feeling misanthropic, my Slytherin brain seems to get a larger share of my think-space. Slytherin brain isn’t evil; instead it’s rational, ethical, and often it pairs up with Ravenclaw brain to provide strong empirical support for its arguments. Slytherin brain is strongly oriented towards achievements and problem-solving; it’s often the reason &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I get stuff done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However Slytherin brain has a reduced coefficient-of-concern—not only for others—but also for my own short-term circumstances. It’s acceptable for myself—or other people—to suffer short-term discomfort if it results in long term good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I’m in a peaceful, stable state, Slytherin brain gives great advice. It means I’ll pass on the thing which seems attractive now, but which I know will prove to be a bad choice later on. It’s why I’ll do boring but essential paperwork when I could be looking at pictures of cats on the Internet. Slytherin brain wields executive function like a boss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However when I’m misanthropic, Slytherin brain presents all sorts of plans to make &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; feel better, but which almost completely ignore the feelings of others. While it acknowledges that being a total jerk isn’t going to make anyone happy, it seem to feel I could be a &lt;em&gt;lot more&lt;/em&gt; of a jerk to get what I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not exactly happy with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’m primarily writing this to help quell my thoughts, I’m certainly not above help and assistance. If you do wish to lend a hand, then please encourage me to get out, get involved, and don’t hesitate to introduce me to others face-to-face. I have a good inclination that with enough exposure to fabulous people my misanthropy will reduce. I hope this year I’ll be able to kick it for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>On Open Source Software And Communities</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Open source software is great. You don’t have to worry about the owner deciding to discontinue it, because someone else can always take over. If there’s a bug that really annoys you—or a feature you really want—you can add it. If you’re concerned about what the software might be doing, you can open it up and take a look. And even if you don’t have the skills or inclination to do all these things, other people will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’ve always known open source software is great, I’m increasingly starting to appreciate that open source &lt;em&gt;developers&lt;/em&gt; are also great. Many people in open source not only have a tremendous amount of experience with software, but also community management. They’ve seen a lot of the same problems arise many times, and so they have a good idea on how to get code, and people, to work together productively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that we see, again and again, in both software and the community, is that giving people agency and discretion is fundamental in having a highly successful project. Wikis lowered the barrier to contribution immensely when it came to collating knowledge, Wikipedia wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t so easy to edit. Many of the most successful software projects have been extremely generous with their commit bits, and with distributed version control, the barriers to contribution have been lowered even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason this is so essential for success is simple. The vast majority of intelligent, motivated people &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to make the world a better place; putting barriers in their way simply means they’ll go elsewhere. Every permission form that needs to be filled in, every registration process that needs to be jumped through, every legal framework that encumbers creation, every strict power hierarchy that needs to be worked through, they all run the risk of taking someone who may done something great instead deciding it was “too hard”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say that we won’t need a way to deal with mishaps; even if nobody is malevolent, some people will still be learning, and everyone will make mistakes. Wikis and distributed version control strike a good balance here, they’re designed around the ability to undo changes, or revert to previous revisions if need be. Much of the software that lower the barriers to contribution also lower the risks associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s the key here. If you can give people a way of doing something, and that process comes with low or negligible risks, then &lt;em&gt;let them do it&lt;/em&gt;. Even if you think nobody will care, even if you think it’s a terrible idea, &lt;em&gt;let them&lt;/em&gt;. Many great ideas start as terrible ones that are refined over time, and you may be surprised at just how popular some ideas can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this doesn’t just apply to your software, or your documentation; this applies to the your culture, and the society in which you live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encourage others to be bold. Be generous in what you accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not stifle innovation. Do not get in the way of people being great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I know that sometimes it can feel like two steps forward, and one step back; but please, please, don’t stop contributing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Admission: I'm a hypocrite</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m going to admit something awful. I’m a hypocrite. I don’t try to hide that. I advocate using one’s resources to make the world a better place, and yet I do a poor job of that myself. I think that raising animals for food is wrong, and yet I still eat meat. I cannot justify these actions in any way that I feel comfortable about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And really, that’s the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be simple for me to find a reason why I don’t care about the suffering of others. Overpopulation is an easy excuse, and it’s one I’ve reached for in the past. There are an endless number of excuses I can reach for to justify eating meat. I have no doubt that I could make a show of defending these positions if I chose to take them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However if I give myself excuses, then I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; hide behind them. And if I believe my own excuses, then I won’t even &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; to change my behaviour. What’s worse, I may even try to justify the behaviour of others who adopt the same behaviour as myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the stigma associated with being a hypocrite, and despite the cognitive dissonance it causes, being a hypocrite provides me with something very valuable: it still allows me to improve myself, and the world, for the better. That social and mental discomfort pushes me towards more ethical choices, and it allows me to support others who are improving in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really want me to challenge your beliefs, then I will, but I would rather welcome you to join me in my hypocrisy. Admit that the suffering of others &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; important—on a global scale—but that we both personally have a lot left to be done to improve our own responses to that.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The ethics of everyday people</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I seem to regularly find myself horrified by the ethics of everyday people. That’s not to say that most people are bad, but we adopt the ethics of the society in which we’re raised, and very few people think about things in any other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people are concerned with what happens nearby, both geographically and temporally. So many of our thoughts are about what happens in our suburb, our country, our circle of friends, our lifetimes. There’s less care for those who live far away, and almost no thought for people living 10,000 years from now. That’s odd if we claim that we care about the welfare of others, because there are &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; people living far away, and &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; people living in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What goes hand-in-hand with this is a tendency to discount any sort of change that doesn’t affect the here-and-now. Hurricane Katrina saw almost &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/08/AR2005090801081.html&quot; title=&quot;Washington Post: Congress approves $51.8 Billion for Victims&quot;&gt;$52 billion dollars in government aid&lt;/a&gt;. It was saving lives “right here, right now”. In comparison, developing effective ways to combat malaria gets relatively ignored, with a total worldwide funding of only about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.impatientoptimists.org/Posts/2013/12/World-Malaria-Report&quot; title=&quot;Impatient Optimists: World Makes Major Gains in Fight Against Malaria&quot;&gt;$2 billion a year&lt;/a&gt;. It’s saving lives in the future, of people who are far away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put things in perspective, Katrina killed almost two thousand people. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9058283/Malaria-death-toll-far-higher-than-previously-thought.html&quot; title=&quot;Telegraph: Malaria death toll far higher than previously thought&quot;&gt;Malaria kills 1.2 MILLION people each year&lt;/a&gt;. Both are tragedies, but malaria is a tragedy on such a scale that it boggles the mind. Even if it takes us 100 years to effectively fight Malaria, that’s suffering which is now eliminated for the &lt;em&gt;rest of human history&lt;/em&gt;. The long term counts. It counts a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not suggesting we ignore our current problems to only look at the future; one of the best ways of improving the future is by improving the present. But we shouldn’t be so quick to dismiss projects simply because they won’t come to fruition in our lifetimes. Nor should we dismiss a suggestion just because it “feels wrong”. In the past, organ transplants, pacemakers, and even &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis#Conflict_with_established_medical_opinions&quot; title=&quot;Ignaz Semmelweis - Conflict with established medical opinions&quot;&gt;washing your surgical instruments after performing an autopsy&lt;/a&gt; “felt wrong”. For many people today, the thought same-sex intercourse &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; “feels wrong”. The human brain is apt to &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; disgust and unease at things which are ethically very &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like more people to think how they can make the world—and the future—a better place. To do that, I need them to think about—and often question—their own beliefs. I delight when I find someone who supports their beliefs with evidence, and who accepts counter-evidence that may falsify their beliefs. These are people who are interested in the truth; and the truth is real whether you “believe” in it or not. These are the same people with whom discussing ethics is a delight, since they’re apt to establish a method of analysis that asks “what harm does this cause, and what benefits does it bring?” rather than to simply declare “it feels wrong” or “it feels right”. These are the people that most often have me question and change my own beliefs, and I love them dearly for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, our default wiring isn’t set that way, and it’s not hard to see why. If someone sacrifices their child to save the lives of a hundred others, that person is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to be universally praised; nor are they likely to even feel good about themselves. Yet if we put value on human lives, then clearly saving the lives of a hundred children is superior to saving just one, even if we feel deeply uncomfortable with the scenario posed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this brings me to my problem. I would like others to think about things rationally; in terms of harm and benefit, in terms of what overall good can be achieved in the world. I would like people to think about their ethical beliefs, and to question &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they feel that way, and whether that’s actually for the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, I would like for people to be more &lt;em&gt;aware&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, in itself, is a hard problem. Ignorance is not only comforting, but it’s strengthening. If a person believes that same-sex marriage is wrong, or that we should turn refugees away from our borders, or that people with different coloured skin are inferior, then that person is unlikely to wish to consider evidence. A naive attempt to present them with evidence may even cause them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactance_(psychology)&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: Reactance (psychology)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;strengthen&lt;/em&gt; their beliefs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s a deeper problem for me personally, one that makes &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; feel uneasy. Living in a little bubble, being unaware of the injustices of the world, being unaware of how one contributes to those injustices… it’s &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt;. Making people more &lt;em&gt;aware&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t make them more &lt;em&gt;happy&lt;/em&gt;; in fact it often does the reverse. Even if someone says they want to know the truth, even if they say they want to learn how to better question themselves and the world, learning the truth has potential to do personal harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s for this reason that I will leave someone’s religious beliefs alone, yet still argue passionately that condoms and sex education are a good idea. It’s for this reason I’ll accept the racist comments of a dying person with sympathy and support, yet pointedly question those same beliefs in a healthy individual. If someone has great power to enact change and make the world a better place—but insists on doing the reverse—then I will argue to the limits of what I consider ethical to try and change that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you find me questioning your beliefs—if you find me trying to change your mind—it means that I feel that you have both the intelligence to change, and the capacity to make the world a better place if you do so. If I’m trying to convince you that you’re wrong, then I’m most assuredly paying you a compliment. And if you’re able to change my own beliefs in the process, then I will be delighted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationally acclaimed public speaker Paul Fenwick talks about depression: What it is, why it sucks, and his own personal experiences in battling it. Drawing from a diverse range of fields, Paul provides insights into the bugs that may exist in your brain, and how some aspects of digital society may even make them worse.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Gamify Your Command Line With Habitrpg</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/privacygeek/hrpg-screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you’re using &lt;a href=&quot;http://habitrpg.com&quot;&gt;HabitRPG&lt;/a&gt; to gamify your life, right? You should be; what could be better than collecting XP and gold for fixing bugs and doing chores and flossing your teeth, and developing a totally kick-arse character you’d want to show off to all your friends?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, doing all that &lt;em&gt;from the command-line&lt;/em&gt;. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I present to you &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href='https://metacpan.org/module/hrpg'&gt;hrpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, a command-line tool to integrate with HabitRPG. It’s still new, but it’s very full featured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;setup&quot;&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, you’ll need a HabitRPG account. Just head over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://habitrpg.com/&quot;&gt;HabitRPG&lt;/a&gt; and make an account using whatever method you like. If you’ve already got a HabitRPG account, that’s excellent!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll also need to install &lt;a href=&quot;https://metacpan.org/module/WebService::HabitRPG&quot;&gt;WebService::HabitRPG&lt;/a&gt; which the &lt;code&gt;hrpg&lt;/code&gt; client is bundled with. The easiest way to do this is with &lt;a href=&quot;http://cpanmin.us&quot;&gt;cpanm&lt;/a&gt;. If you don’t have &lt;code&gt;cpanm&lt;/code&gt; installed, I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://privacygeek.blogspot.com.au/2013/03/the-worlds-easiest-guide-to-installing.html&quot;&gt;super-easy guide for you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cpanm WebService::HabitRPG&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On HabitRPG, head over to Settings, and navigate to the API tab. There’ll be a user-id and an API-key here. Use your favourite editor to open a &lt;code&gt;.habitrpgrc&lt;/code&gt; file in your home directory with the following format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[auth]
user_id   = xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
api_token = xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace the long strings of ‘x’s with your user id and API token from the HabitRPG website, and we’re ready to go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using_hrpg&quot;&gt;Using hrpg&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to get started with hrpg is to run it with no arguments. This will provide you with a help display:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ hrpg

Usage:

hrpg status                  : Show current HP/XP/GP
hrpg tasks                   : Show current tasks
hrpg habit|daily|reward|todo : Show tasks of current type
hrpg new                     : Create new task 'hrpg new' for help.
hrpg [+-] task               : Increment/decrement a task or habit

Debugging commands:

hrpg dump                    : Dump entire user info
hrpg dump tasks              : Dump task info&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these commands are pretty straightforward. For example, if I type hrpg status I’ll get some basic info about my character:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ hrpg status

Hark, Paul Fenwick! (Lv 3)

HP: 45.7 / 50
XP: 25 / 170
GP: 30 | SP: 54 | CP: 18&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However there are a few things which require a little more explanation, and will make your HabitRPG experience much nicer! Firstly, let’s find out how to make a task:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ hrpg new

Usage: hrpg new [habit|todo|daily] +- &amp;quot;name&amp;quot; [&amp;quot;note&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three different tasks we can make. Daily tasks are things we want to do every day, like brush our teeth, practice our anki cards, or fill in our idonethis log. They give us XP and coins when we complete them, and will damage our HP if we neglect them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Todo items are things which need to be done, but only once. Something like paying a bill, or booking a flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habits are things which we want to get into—or out of—the habit of doing. For example, we might want to get penalised whenever we eat junk food or smoke a cigarette, or rewarded whenever we exercise or respond to a client email. Habits can be triggered multiple times per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; modifiers tell HabitRPG if something is good, bad, or potentially both. For example, you might have a ‘pomodoro’ habit which rewards you for working solidly for a period of time, or penalises you if you get distracted when you’re supposed to be working solidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, all tasks need a name. This is what shows up in the web interface, but most importantly for us any unique abbreviation of this name is how we’ll refer to our tasks in hrpg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes are entirely optional, and will show up as tool-tips in the web interface if you use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let’s make a few tasks. We’ll have one that rewards us for drinking water, and penalises us for drinking unhealthy drinks. We’ll have another one for responding to email (something I personally suck at), and another daily goal to floss our teeth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;hrpg new habit +- &amp;quot;Drink healthily&amp;quot;
hrpg new habit + &amp;quot;Respond to email&amp;quot;
hrpg new daily + &amp;quot;Floss teeth&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we’ve set up tasks, we can tell HabitRPG that we’ve completed them. For example, if we drank a refreshing but unhealthy drink, and then flossed our teeth, we could use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ hrpg - drink
$ hrpg + floss&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that any unique abbreviation of our task name is acceptable. If we try an abbreviation that isn’t unique, hrpg will provide us with a list of options, along with their unique task IDs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ hrpg + pomodoro

Did you mean...

* Pomodoro of paid work (12fb2922-74be-45d3-b9ed-11e2fa1721c9)
* Pomodoro of anything useful (424e327c-9738-4743-ac74-b9f5c528b555)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an added bonus, if you’re already a user for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pjf.id.au/privacygeek/2013/02/10/reimplementing-the-idonethis-memory-service.html&quot;&gt;idone command line client&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://idonethis.com/&quot;&gt;http://idonethis.com/&lt;/a&gt;, then you can mark a habit as done, and record a note in idonethis &lt;em&gt;at the same time&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;hrpg + email &amp;quot;Sent quote on flux capacitors to Dr Brown&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, if HabitRPG supports logging tasks with notes, these will also be appended to your HabitRPG log.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;under_the_hood&quot;&gt;Under the hood&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hrpg sits on top of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://metacpan.org/module/WebService::HabitRPG&quot;&gt;WebService::HabitRPG&lt;/a&gt; module for &lt;a href=&quot;http://perl.org&quot;&gt;Perl&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re interested in reporting bugs, suggesting features, improving the docs, or even contributing code yourself, you can find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pjf/WebService-HabitRPG&quot;&gt;repository on github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Reimplementing the iDoneThis Memory Service</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;There’s an excellent website called &lt;a href=&quot;http://idonethis.com/&quot;&gt;iDoneThis.com&lt;/a&gt; which implements the most simple yet brilliant of services. Every day, you record the list of things you’ve done, and it gives you a check-mark for that day. This was motivating in two ways: firstly, the desire to keep that chain of check-marks running (what’s known as a ‘chain calendar’ or a ‘Seinfeld calendar’), and secondly by emailing you your memories of what you were doing a year (or a week, or a month) ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, knowing what I was doing a year ago was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good. I loved waking up each morning to be reminding of something I might otherwise not think of again. The good memories I was emailed would make me feel good again, and bad memories? Well, they’d often make me feel good that I wasn’t going through &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; anymore, or they’d be &lt;em&gt;insightful&lt;/em&gt; if I was encountering similar issues now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; the memory service, and so did my friends, even if they didn’t use it. I’d often send them messages about what awesome adventures we were up to a year ago, and that would often make their day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, a few months ago, iDoneThis discontinued their memory-posting service. I don’t know why; I can only assume they’re focusing on the more corporate part of their service, and the network costs of all the personal emails wasn’t worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, as part of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://lesswrong.com/lw/3w3/how_to_beat_procrastination/&quot;&gt;productivity spiral&lt;/a&gt;, I reimplemented the old memories service. The code isn’t pretty—unfortunately iDoneThis doesn’t (yet) provide an API—but I have a bot that can log-in and fetch a day’s worth of data. Best of all, that code is open source, and &lt;a href=&quot;href=&quot;https://metacpan.org/module/WebService::Idonethis&quot;&gt;available from the CPAN&lt;/a&gt;, so you can download and use it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re not a Perl person, then it’s pretty easy to install. Simply follow my &lt;a href=&quot;http://privacygeek.blogspot.com.au/2013/03/the-worlds-easiest-guide-to-installing.html&quot;&gt;world’s simplest guide to installing cpanm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now just install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://metacpan.org/module/WebService::Idonethis&quot;&gt;WebService::Idonethis&quot;&gt;WebService::Idonethis&lt;/a&gt; module:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cpanm WebService::Idonethis&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use it, you’ll first need to create an &lt;code&gt;~/.idonethisrc&lt;/code&gt; file with your auth details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[auth]
user=someuser
pass=somepass&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all has gone well, you can now use the &lt;code&gt;idonethis-memories&lt;/code&gt; command!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ idonethis-memories

Here's what you were doing on 2012-02-11:

* Built a robotic dinosaur with lasers with Claudine.
* Played stepmania with Deanna (Spice Girls rock!)
* Invoiced ALL the clients.
* Drank six billion cups of coffee.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s perfect for putting into a cron job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit:&lt;/em&gt; As of v0.03, you can now submit done items directly from the command line using the &lt;code&gt;idone&lt;/code&gt; tool:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ idone &amp;quot;Read a great blog by Paul Fenwick&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit:&lt;/em&gt; As of v0.04, you can also get a list of what you’ve done today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ idone -l

* Flossed my teeth
* Looked at pictures of cats on the Internet
* Defended against a goblin siege in Dwarf Fortress&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re handy with Perl, or just want to look at the code, there’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pjf/idonethis-perl&quot;&gt;github repository&lt;/a&gt;. Patches are extremely welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: As of v0.08, the &lt;code&gt;idone -lc&lt;/code&gt; command is the best thing ever. It will list the things you’ve done today, and allow you to add new things by entering them on stdin. It also has less than one third of the previous dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Perl Renaissance is in full swing. Object frameworks and syntax have been undated, web frameworks are easy and powerful, and modules are easy to manage and install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overhauling Perl’s Object Oriented framework with Moose.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Using MooseX::Method::Signatures for beautiful classes.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Building web applications using Dancer&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Not worrying about web servers by using Plack.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Critiquing your code with Perl::Critic&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Write amazing regexps with named captures.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Install new modules quickly and easily with cpanminus&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Manage Perl installations easily with perlbrew&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A whole swag of new features with perl 5.10–5.16&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Much, much more!&lt;/li&gt;
