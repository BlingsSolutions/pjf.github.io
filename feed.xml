				<title>How to screw learning with one simple belief</title>
				<description>&lt;figure class='right'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/ethics/praise-fail.png' /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This. Right here. Look at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a graph showing the performance of children after they’ve been praised for their intelligence (“you must be smart”) versus their effort (“you must have put a lot of effort into that”), and then given a series of hard problems to try and solve. The kids who are taught that effort count &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; in the number of problems they can solve. Those who are told that they’re smart show a frightening decrease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the difference? Those being told that they’re smart are taught that abilities are fixed. If you’re finding a puzzle hard, then it must be because you’re not very good at that, and you should try something else. Kids taught that results are based on effort see the hard puzzles as something they can &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt; to do, and then they do so¹.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class='right'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/ethics/praise-preference.png' /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is shown really clearly in the second graph. Children are asked what type of puzzles they’d like to solve, and are given four options. The first three are pretty similar: “problems that aren’t too hard, so I don’t get many wrong,” “problems that are pretty easy, so I’ll do well,” and “problems that I’m pretty good at, so I can show that I’m smart.” However the last option is different: “problems that I’ll learn a lot from, even if I won’t look so smart.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first three options are “performance” options, they’re all about looking good, or getting things right. The last option is a “learning” option, and it values knowledge and growth over performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second graph shows how often children selected performance options based upon the type of praise they were given. Children praised for their intelligence choose tasks which are easy and make them look good; children praised for their effort choose tasks which are hard, and which will teach them more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is important enough, but there are social ramifications as well. People with more fixed views of ability are more likely to adopt stereotypes, and are less likely to develop to higher levels of ethical reasoning than those with dynamic views of ability². And this doesn’t seem to have a damn thing to do with cognitive abilities; it’s all about outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not go through life believing that you lack a talent, and do not allow others to believe that about themselves. Humans have an amazing capacity for growth; learning is hard, but it’s &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Don't read articles, listen to them</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This morning I pottered around the kitchen. I made toast and coffee, I washed the dishes, I sorted my groceries. I also read a lengthy article on AIDS in China at the same time. In fact, I’ve been reading more than ever now that I’ve given up on actually &lt;em&gt;reading&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t hide the fact that I want to learn everything. I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://ankisrs.net/&quot; title=&quot;Anki: Powerful, intelligent flashcards&quot;&gt;flashcards&lt;/a&gt; that I practice every day, I’m enrolled in more &lt;a href=&quot;https://coursera.org/&quot; title=&quot;Coursera: Take free online classes from 80+ top universities and organisations&quot;&gt;coursera&lt;/a&gt; courses than I can poke a stick at, and my most favourite thing in the world is to find someone with specialised knowledge and enthusiasm and talk to them about it in depth. Consequently, I do a lot of thinking about how to learn efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing which is very apparent to me is that I have limited resources when it comes to concentration. If I’m having a conversation, or writing an article, or hacking code, then that concentration slot is full; I can’t do anything else that requires much cognition at the same time. It’s concentration that’s my limited resource when it comes to learning and creating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, there are so many times each day when I’m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; concentrating on something, and yet have the capacity to do so. Public transport, making breakfast, even sitting on the loo. Sometimes those times are used for serious thinking, but often they’re just filled with frivolous or even anxious thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a good solution to this. And for me, it’s been game-changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a free app called &lt;a href=&quot;http://getpocket.com/&quot; title=&quot;Pocket: Save for later. Put articles, videos or pretty much anything into Pocket.&quot;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt;. It takes articles, turns them into a format that looks great on mobile devices, and syncs them so you can read them anywhere. That’s nice; but by itself it still means I need to have my phone out to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clincher is that Pocket for Android comes with built-in text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities. If you combine it with a TTS engine that doesn’t suck, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ivona.com/&quot; title=&quot;IVONA: Award winning, natural text-to-speech for desktop, mobile, server and web.&quot;&gt;Ivona&lt;/a&gt; immediately springs to mind here, then you have a &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; easier way of “reading” articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination is so nice that I read articles almost exclusively via Pocket and Ivona now. I’m even adding &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/pjf/exobrain&quot; title=&quot;Exobrain: A collection of agents which collect, classify, and act upon data&quot;&gt;exobrain&lt;/a&gt; capabilities sending me an article on social media will automatically add it to my reading queues. Of course, all my writing on &lt;a href=&quot;http://pjf.id.au/&quot; title=&quot;Paul Fenwick's personal website&quot;&gt;pjf.id.au&lt;/a&gt; sounds great in Pocket, too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, Pocket for iOS lacks the built-in TTS capabilities; I’ve been told iOS lacks an easy-to-use speech interface for developers. However many third-party apps seem to have sprung up to fill this niche. If you have any good experiences, I’d love to hear about them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Automated backups with udev and btrfs</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m incredibly lazy. My preferred way of making backups is to plug in an external drive, and have my laptop automatically do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to facilitate this laziness, I’m going to be using two tools: btrfs (an amazing filesystem with snapshot support), and udev (which can detect when a device has been inserted or removed). I’m also going to send notifcations directly to my Pebble watch, because I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything in this guide needs to be done as root, so we might as well start a root-shell now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo -i&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preparing_our_disk&quot;&gt;Preparing our disk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/01/bitrot-and-atomic-cows-inside-next-gen-filesystems/&quot; title=&quot;Bitrot and atomic COWs: Inside next-gen filesystems&quot;&gt;btrfs&lt;/a&gt; for external backups. It’s able to detect when data has gone bad, it has wicked-cool snapshot capabilities, and if I’m backing up an existing btrfs filesystem I can do very quickly and efficiently by sending incremental snapshots. However most of this guide will still work even if you’re using a different filesystem type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first step is to prepare the disk where our backups are going to live. under Linux we can have volumes with &lt;em&gt;labels&lt;/em&gt;. They’re awesome, because they’re human readable, but still provide a way to identify a device regardless of where it gets mounted. In theory one could have a number of drives with the same label, and we could trigger a backup automatically whenever &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of them are plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With btrfs, we can set the label when we format the disk, but I always forget to do that. It’s okay, because changing the label is easy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ btrfs filesystem label /dev/sdc1 backup&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re using &lt;code&gt;ext2&lt;/code&gt; or above, you can do the same with &lt;code&gt;tune2fs&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ tune2fs -L backup /dev/sdc1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My actual disks have more descriptive labels, indicating both the machine and filesystem they’re responsible for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to mount my backups in a consistent location, so I’m going to create that now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ mkdir /mnt/backup&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also need to tell linux that when it sees a disk with the &lt;code&gt;backup&lt;/code&gt; label, it needs to go on the mount-point specified. We do this by adding a line to &lt;code&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt;, and we can also specify other options in here as well For example, I use btrfs’ compression option:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ echo &amp;quot;LABEL=backup /mnt/backup btrfs noauto,compress 0 2&amp;quot; \
    &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On other filesystems, you should leave out ‘compress’ on the line above. The ‘noauto’ option tells Linux not to try and mount the drive when booting; as a removable backup drive, it’s unlikely to be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;udev&quot;&gt;udev&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the bit which caused me pain, &lt;code&gt;udev&lt;/code&gt;, a system for triggering events when devices change on your system. I don’t know if there are versions of &lt;code&gt;udev&lt;/code&gt; with different keywords, or which care differently about capitalisation, but it took a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of tweaking around until I managed to get a udev rule that would automatically mount my disk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cat &amp;gt; /etc/udev/rules.d/99-backup.rules

SUBSYSTEM==&amp;quot;block&amp;quot;, ENV{ID_FS_LABEL}==&amp;quot;backup&amp;quot;, ACTION==&amp;quot;add&amp;quot;, \
    RUN+=&amp;quot;/bin/mount /mnt/backup&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Udev is also supposed to automatically pick up new rules, but my system didn’t the first time. We can nudge it with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ udevadm control --reload-rules&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;backups&quot;&gt;Backups&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make backups I’m using rsync. I use both &lt;code&gt;ionice&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;nice&lt;/code&gt; to have our command yield both io and cpu resources to other processes, so we don’t lose system responsiveness during the backup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also use the &lt;code&gt;-vHAaxX&lt;/code&gt; switches to &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt;. This backups up &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;erbosely, &lt;code&gt;H&lt;/code&gt;ard links, &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;CLs, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;ll, &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;tended attributions, and sticking to one filesystem (&lt;code&gt;-x&lt;/code&gt;). I also pass in &lt;code&gt;--delete&lt;/code&gt; to remove files from the backup drive that are no longer on my machine’s disk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I also pass &lt;code&gt;--filter 'P SNAPSHOT-*&lt;/code&gt;, to tell rsync to protect any file at the destination which starts with &lt;code&gt;SNAPSHOT-&lt;/code&gt;. As we’ll see in a moment, these are my btrfs snapshots; we don’t want rsync to try and remove them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ionice -c3 nice rsync -vHAaxX --delete \
    --filter 'P SNAPSHOT-*' / /mnt/backup/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this is done (it can take some time), I take a read-only btrfs snapshot on my backup drive with the current date in UTC:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ btrfs subvolume snapshot -r /mnt/backup \
    /mnt/backup/SNAPSHOT-`date -u +%Y-%m-%d`&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the joys of btrfs is the top-level filesystem on my backup drive is arranged exactly the same way as the filesystem I’m backing up. In a pinch I could use it a a drop-in replacement. If a file doesn’t change between snapshots, then btrfs requires no additional storage space to store it, and with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/g2p/bedup&quot; title=&quot;bedup: btrfs de-duplication&quot;&gt;bedup&lt;/a&gt; we can even de-duplicate files across filesystems and subvolumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each snapshot is also a complete backup in its own right; I never have to worry about whether I have a base filesystem upon which to apply an incremental backup on to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;automating_everything_with_snapback&quot;&gt;Automating everything with snapback&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Snapback&lt;/code&gt; is some code I wrote because anything more than plugging in a USB drive to my laptop is just too much work. It uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://pushover.net/&quot; title=&quot;Pushover: Simple mobile notifications&quot;&gt;Pushover&lt;/a&gt; to send notifications to my pebble watch, so there’s no need to look through &lt;code&gt;/var/log&lt;/code&gt; to see what’s happening, and I’m immediately notified when the backup is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It ties all the above together into a script that’s triggered from udev. Because udev kills any process that’s running too long, under the hood we fork a daemon to do the heavy lifting for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Snapback&lt;/code&gt; is pretty heavily customised to work on my laptop, but you’re welcome to adapt it to your own purposes if you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pjf/snapback&quot; title=&quot;Snapback: Automatically backup your machine to btrfs when a disk is plugged in (GitHub)&quot;&gt;find snapback on github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;Credits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a class='social-link' href='https://twitter.com/jeremyvisser'&gt;Jeremy Visser&lt;/a&gt; for pointing out &lt;code&gt;sudo -i&lt;/code&gt; as a more comfortable way to get a root shell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Website Privacy and You</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Too many entities want to know too much about you, and one of the sneakiest ways they do this is to get website author to add third-party tracking information to their own site. The value to the website operator is often a service, feature, or even revenue, but that doesn’t change the fact that having third parties track your information sure &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; skeezy to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;http://pjf.id.au/&quot; title=&quot;Paul Fenwick's personal website&quot;&gt;pjf.id.au&lt;/a&gt; I use three third-party services: AddThis, Google Analytics, and Disqus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;addthis&quot;&gt;AddThis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AddThis provides an easy way to add sharing links to content. They integrate with just about everything, and they provide the content author with information as to how content is being shared, and how many views are because of that sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AddThis provide a simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.addthis.com/privacy/opt-out&quot; title=&quot;AddThis opt-out&quot;&gt;opt-out button&lt;/a&gt; to prevent them from collecting and sharing information about you. Opting-out doesn’t stop you from using the share buttons, it just protects your privacy. I recommend you use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;google_analytics&quot;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Google Analytics to get an overview of who’s visiting my site. By default, Analytics receives your entire IP address, but I feel that Google already knows too much about you, so I ask them to collect &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=2919631&quot;&gt;less information&lt;/a&gt; by partially anonymising your IP address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google would also love to &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2700409&quot;&gt;cross-reference your data&lt;/a&gt; with existing advertising cookies to determine demographics such as age, gender and intrests. I have that firmly turned off, but you can be pretty sure most everywhere else on the web has it turned on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google gives you a way to &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881&quot;&gt;permanently opting out of analytics&lt;/a&gt; by using an open-source browser add-on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google also provides a way to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin&quot;&gt;permanently opt-out of targetted advertising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;disqus&quot;&gt;Disqus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disqus provides a pretty excellent way of adding comments and discussions to articles. However they also make their money from advertising, and have no opt-out button when it comes to collecting your information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to require that you identify yourself to a third party to comment on my writings, so I’ve enabled anonymous comments This is also likely to increase the number of spam and junk comments a little, so I’d appreciate you flagging those if you see them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;opting_out_of_everything_at_aboutads&quot;&gt;Opting out of everything at AboutAds&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds of advertising agencies out there who keep personalised information about you. Some of them participate in a self-regulatory program to make it easier for users to opt-out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;strongly&lt;/em&gt; recommend you visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aboutads.info/choices/&quot;&gt;Opt Out page&lt;/a&gt; at AboutAds, which provides an interface to opt-out from over a hundred advertising services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fixing_everything_with_noscript&quot;&gt;Fixing everything with NoScript&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One excellent solution to opt-out of &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is to use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://noscript.net/&quot; title=&quot;NoScript: JavaScript/Java/Flash blocker for a safer Firefox experience&quot;&gt;NoScript&lt;/a&gt; extension for Firefox. While modestly inconvenient to use at first, NoScript makes it very easy to temporarily or permanently block domains and features you don’t want, which results in a much cleaner, faster, and more private web experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, NoScript only exists for Firefox-based browsers. Recommendations for other browsers are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.torproject.org/&quot;&gt;Tor Project&lt;/a&gt; also provides pretty serious anonymity functionality that works with any browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Unfortunately, the search box on my site may give you ads. Google doesn’t let you disable that unless you’re a registered non-profit, which I’m currently not. The search box does not interact with Google in any way unless you submit a search using it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>A new website, a new philosophy</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, the server on which I hosted my personal website suffered a hardware failure and died. It had been running for over a decade and the design had &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20110216060633/http://www.pjf.id.au/&quot;&gt;not changed once&lt;/a&gt; during that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very glad to say that I’ve now resurrected the site, along with the over ten years worth of writing I had there. However what I’m really excited about is the technology and philosophy of how the new site is constructed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do a &lt;a href=&quot;/ethics&quot; title=&quot;Paul Fenwick's writings on ethics and philosophy&quot;&gt;lot of writing&lt;/a&gt; on how I feel the world could be a better place, and much of that comes down to changing the way in which we think. Our society teaches us odd values; we’re told sharing and generosity are good, and they are &lt;em&gt;exceptional&lt;/em&gt; traits to have. Literally; they are something which is an exception or deviation from expected behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We teach people to share, but then we expect them not to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to change that. It costs me nothing to share my digital works; the value for me is in making the world a better place, and I want to make it easy for others to do the same. That’s the philosophy behind pjf.id.au.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So first of all, this is a website built on respect for one’s audience. There are no advertisements; I have no hosting costs to defray. There are no tricks, I want to be honest in what I’m presenting. The website looks good at any resolution, and on any browser that respects standards. I use a few third-party tools to make it easier to share and comment on posts, or for me to see how the site is being used, but wherever possible I’ve disabled any functionality they may have which tracks individual users, or shares information with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly to me, I’m making all my writing available under a &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/&quot; title=&quot;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License&quot;&gt;Creative Commons Attribution&lt;/a&gt; license. In short, you can use, modify, and redistribute it—even commercially—as long as you provide attribution and facilitate others doing the same. There’s almost 700 pieces of work, stretching back over a decade, and I’m still importing much of my work that’s been scattered across the net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to make it easy for you to re-use my work, so everything, including content and underlying infrastructure, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pjf/pjf.github.io&quot;&gt;available on github&lt;/a&gt;. You can fork and clone the entire website, and try to do a better job of being me if you like. More importantly, you can use the &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt; branch to have a website with all the features and design I enjoy, but with configuration and content you supply. If this excites you, then you may also wish to look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://octopress.org/&quot; title=&quot;Octopress: A blogging framework for hackers&quot;&gt;Octopress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally important, you can modify my work in-place, in case you find errors or omissions, or you wish to help with the tagging and classification of older pieces of writing. Right now that requires you to be comfortable with git, but I plan to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pjf/pjf.github.io/issues/11&quot;&gt;add edit buttons&lt;/a&gt; directly on to each article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of what I’m doing here would be possible without the generosity of others doing the same, and so there are a number of thank yous that are very well deserved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design of pjf.id.au is by the amazing &lt;a class='social-link' href='https://twitter.com/n33co'&gt;@n33co&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://html5up.net/&quot; title=&quot;HTML5 UP! Responsive HTML5 and CSS3 Site Templates&quot;&gt;html5up&lt;/a&gt;, who makes beautiful, responsive, and standards-compliant web designs available for free, also under Creative Commons licensing. They are all incredible, and I cannot recommend them enough. If you’re looking at starting your own website, and are in need of a beautiful design, please do visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://html5up.net/&quot; title=&quot;HTML5 UP! Responsive HTML5 and CSS3 Site Templates&quot;&gt;html5up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pjf.id.au is powered by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot; title=&quot;Jekyll: Simple, blog aware, static sites&quot;&gt;jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, a free, open-source infrastructure engine written in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ruby-lang.org/&quot; title=&quot;Ruby Programming Language&quot;&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;. It’s hosted—for free—by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot; title=&quot;GitHub: Build software better, together&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;, who continuously amaze me with the support and services they provide to the open source community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to give a special thanks to &lt;a class='social-link' href='https://github.com/techman83'&gt;Leon Wright&lt;/a&gt;, who has not only created &lt;a href=&quot;http://techman83.me/&quot; title=&quot;techman83: Leon Wright&quot;&gt;his own website&lt;/a&gt; based upon my design, but also sent me numerous patches and features to not only improve my own website, but to allow others to re-use our collective works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So please, share and enjoy, and if you like my work I’d love to hear about it below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Paul&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit&lt;/em&gt;: Within a couple of ours of posting this, the amazing &lt;a class='social-link' href='https://github.com/rhunter'&gt;Rob Hunter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pjf/pjf.github.io/pull/14&quot;&gt;supplied a patch&lt;/a&gt; adding edit links to the top of all articles!

				<title>Use Markdown Instead Of BBCode With Vimperator</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I really love the Dwarf Fortress community, and a lot of it is centred around the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php&quot;&gt;bay12 forums&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, I don’t love BBCode (aka phpBB syntax), which is what the bay12 forums require me to write posts in. I’d much rather use &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax&quot;&gt;markdown&lt;/a&gt;. So I decided to fix that with the help of vimperator, and by writing my own markdown to BBcode parser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://metacpan.org/pod/Markdown::phpBB&quot;&gt;Markdown::phpBB&lt;/a&gt; module from the CPAN, you’ll find a nifty little program named &lt;code&gt;md2phpbb&lt;/code&gt;. This is a filter; it takes input in markdown, and emits output in BBcode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cpanm Markdown::phpBB     # install using cpanm
$ cpan  Markdown::phpBB     # install using classic cpan&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re editing in vim, you can run &lt;code&gt;:%!md2phpbb&lt;/code&gt; to replace your current buffer (written in markdown) with the equivalent text in BBcode. You can even bind it to a key, as I’ve done in my &lt;code&gt;~/.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;:nmap &amp;lt;F5&amp;gt; :%!md2phpbb&amp;lt;CR&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve installed md2phpbb into a user (rather than system) directory, then you may find that vimperator won’t have your perl-specific environment variables in place. In that case you can use full paths in your &lt;code&gt;~/.vimrc&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;:nmap &amp;lt;F5&amp;gt; :%!perl -I/home/pjf/perl5/lib/perl5 /home/pjf/perl5/bin/md2phpbb&amp;lt;CR&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vimperator.org/vimperator&quot;&gt;vimperator&lt;/a&gt; then you can already invoke vim from any textarea by pressing &lt;code&gt;ctrl-i&lt;/code&gt;. However BBcode websites usually bind this to &lt;em&gt;italics&lt;/em&gt;, so you’ll probably want to add an additional key for editing to your &lt;code&gt;~/.vimperatorrc&lt;/code&gt; file. I use &lt;code&gt;ctrl-e&lt;/code&gt;, for edit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;:inoremap &amp;lt;C-e&amp;gt; &amp;lt;C-i&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can use &lt;code&gt;ctrl-e&lt;/code&gt; to open a vim window, write your response in markdown, and then just hit &lt;code&gt;F5&lt;/code&gt; to turn it into BBCode. Best of all, the filter doesn’t change existing BBCode at all, so you can hit &lt;code&gt;F5&lt;/code&gt; as many times as you like, to refresh your text after edits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;md2phpbb&lt;/code&gt; and supporting libraries are completely free and open source, and can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pjf/Markdown-phpBB&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Depression—An Update</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In late 2012 I had a depressive episode. This is well documented; &lt;a href=&quot;2012-11-29-i-have-depression-an-open-letter-by-paul-fenwick.html&quot;&gt;I wrote about it on-line&lt;/a&gt;, and I even &lt;a href=&quot;http://pjf.id.au/talks/2013/07/24/depression-bugs-in-your-brain.html&quot;&gt;gave a talk at OSCON&lt;/a&gt;. My thought processes during that time were broken and cyclical; cognitively I knew that people were great, but emotionally I found myself intensely disliking them. As someone who’s long derived joy and energy from those around me, I seemed to spend all my energy arguing with the emotional part of myself that people &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; great… and yet it wouldn’t listen. The situation was exhausting, and I didn’t get anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I struck a deal. I would admit that perhaps people aren’t as great as I once thought, and that emotional monkey-brain would quieten down and let me think again. It worked, and I’d joke with my role-playing friends I recovered by taking a point in misanthropy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a good deal, because I knew that point in misanthropy could eventually be removed, and because &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; was better than being in the state I was back then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the misanthropy stuck around. It’s not as bad as it used to be, but it’s definitely there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have noticed me at less events in 2013, and part of that’s because the thought of seeing people has often been completely unappealing. Usually when I’m at an event, I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; social and happy, but the misanthropy often comes back as soon as I leave. Sometimes it comes back hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans have a knack of making up plausible excuses for our own behaviour, and then believing those excuses to be real¹. We have the same knack when it comes to emotions. We’ll look for things in our environment try to explain why we’re feeling a particular way, and believe they’re &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; the reason we feel that way².&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, when I’m feeling misanthropic, it’s hard for me to tell which thoughts of mine are actually legitimate, and which thoughts only &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; legitimate because of my emotional state. Often I’m appalled when I look back at some of my thoughts when I feel this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers of &lt;a href=&quot;http://hpmor.com/&quot;&gt;HPMOR&lt;/a&gt; will be familiar with assigning labels to the different viewpoints in one’s own head. When I’m feeling misanthropic, my Slytherin brain seems to get a larger share of my think-space. Slytherin brain isn’t evil; instead it’s rational, ethical, and often it pairs up with Ravenclaw brain to provide strong empirical support for its arguments. Slytherin brain is strongly oriented towards achievements and problem-solving; it’s often the reason &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I get stuff done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However Slytherin brain has a reduced coefficient-of-concern—not only for others—but also for my own short-term circumstances. It’s acceptable for myself—or other people—to suffer short-term discomfort if it results in long term good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I’m in a peaceful, stable state, Slytherin brain gives great advice. It means I’ll pass on the thing which seems attractive now, but which I know will prove to be a bad choice later on. It’s why I’ll do boring but essential paperwork when I could be looking at pictures of cats on the Internet. Slytherin brain wields executive function like a boss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However when I’m misanthropic, Slytherin brain presents all sorts of plans to make &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; feel better, but which almost completely ignore the feelings of others. While it acknowledges that being a total jerk isn’t going to make anyone happy, it seem to feel I could be a &lt;em&gt;lot more&lt;/em&gt; of a jerk to get what I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not exactly happy with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’m primarily writing this to help quell my thoughts, I’m certainly not above help and assistance. If you do wish to lend a hand, then please encourage me to get out, get involved, and don’t hesitate to introduce me to others face-to-face. I have a good inclination that with enough exposure to fabulous people my misanthropy will reduce. I hope this year I’ll be able to kick it for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>On Open Source Software And Communities</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Open source software is great. You don’t have to worry about the owner deciding to discontinue it, because someone else can always take over. If there’s a bug that really annoys you—or a feature you really want—you can add it. If you’re concerned about what the software might be doing, you can open it up and take a look. And even if you don’t have the skills or inclination to do all these things, other people will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’ve always known open source software is great, I’m increasingly starting to appreciate that open source &lt;em&gt;developers&lt;/em&gt; are also great. Many people in open source not only have a tremendous amount of experience with software, but also community management. They’ve seen a lot of the same problems arise many times, and so they have a good idea on how to get code, and people, to work together productively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that we see, again and again, in both software and the community, is that giving people agency and discretion is fundamental in having a highly successful project. Wikis lowered the barrier to contribution immensely when it came to collating knowledge, Wikipedia wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t so easy to edit. Many of the most successful software projects have been extremely generous with their commit bits, and with distributed version control, the barriers to contribution have been lowered even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason this is so essential for success is simple. The vast majority of intelligent, motivated people &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to make the world a better place; putting barriers in their way simply means they’ll go elsewhere. Every permission form that needs to be filled in, every registration process that needs to be jumped through, every legal framework that encumbers creation, every strict power hierarchy that needs to be worked through, they all run the risk of taking someone who may done something great instead deciding it was “too hard”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say that we won’t need a way to deal with mishaps; even if nobody is malevolent, some people will still be learning, and everyone will make mistakes. Wikis and distributed version control strike a good balance here, they’re designed around the ability to undo changes, or revert to previous revisions if need be. Much of the software that lower the barriers to contribution also lower the risks associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s the key here. If you can give people a way of doing something, and that process comes with low or negligible risks, then &lt;em&gt;let them do it&lt;/em&gt;. Even if you think nobody will care, even if you think it’s a terrible idea, &lt;em&gt;let them&lt;/em&gt;. Many great ideas start as terrible ones that are refined over time, and you may be surprised at just how popular some ideas can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this doesn’t just apply to your software, or your documentation; this applies to the your culture, and the society in which you live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encourage others to be bold. Be generous in what you accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not stifle innovation. Do not get in the way of people being great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I know that sometimes it can feel like two steps forward, and one step back; but please, please, don’t stop contributing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Admission: I'm a hypocrite</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m going to admit something awful. I’m a hypocrite. I don’t try to hide that. I advocate using one’s resources to make the world a better place, and yet I do a poor job of that myself. I think that raising animals for food is wrong, and yet I still eat meat. I cannot justify these actions in any way that I feel comfortable about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And really, that’s the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be simple for me to find a reason why I don’t care about the suffering of others. Overpopulation is an easy excuse, and it’s one I’ve reached for in the past. There are an endless number of excuses I can reach for to justify eating meat. I have no doubt that I could make a show of defending these positions if I chose to take them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However if I give myself excuses, then I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; hide behind them. And if I believe my own excuses, then I won’t even &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; to change my behaviour. What’s worse, I may even try to justify the behaviour of others who adopt the same behaviour as myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the stigma associated with being a hypocrite, and despite the cognitive dissonance it causes, being a hypocrite provides me with something very valuable: it still allows me to improve myself, and the world, for the better. That social and mental discomfort pushes me towards more ethical choices, and it allows me to support others who are improving in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really want me to challenge your beliefs, then I will, but I would rather welcome you to join me in my hypocrisy. Admit that the suffering of others &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; important—on a global scale—but that we both personally have a lot left to be done to improve our own responses to that.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The ethics of everyday people</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I seem to regularly find myself horrified by the ethics of everyday people. That’s not to say that most people are bad, but we adopt the ethics of the society in which we’re raised, and very few people think about things in any other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people are concerned with what happens nearby, both geographically and temporally. So many of our thoughts are about what happens in our suburb, our country, our circle of friends, our lifetimes. There’s less care for those who live far away, and almost no thought for people living 10,000 years from now. That’s odd if we claim that we care about the welfare of others, because there are &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; people living far away, and &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; people living in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What goes hand-in-hand with this is a tendency to discount any sort of change that doesn’t affect the here-and-now. Hurricane Katrina saw almost &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/08/AR2005090801081.html&quot; title=&quot;Congress approves $51.8 Billion for Victims (Washington Post)&quot;&gt;$52 billion dollars in government aid&lt;/a&gt;. It was saving lives “right here, right now”. In comparison, developing effective ways to combat malaria gets relatively ignored, with a total worldwide funding of only about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.impatientoptimists.org/Posts/2013/12/World-Malaria-Report&quot; title=&quot;World Makes Major Gains in Fight Against Malaria (Impatient Optimists)&quot;&gt;$2 billion a year&lt;/a&gt;. It’s saving lives in the future, of people who are far away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put things in perspective, Katrina killed almost two thousand people. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9058283/Malaria-death-toll-far-higher-than-previously-thought.html&quot; title=&quot;Malaria death toll far higher than previously thought (Telegraph)&quot;&gt;Malaria kills 1.2 MILLION people each year&lt;/a&gt;. Both are tragedies, but malaria is a tragedy on such a scale that it boggles the mind. Even if it takes us 100 years to effectively fight Malaria, that’s suffering which is now eliminated for the &lt;em&gt;rest of human history&lt;/em&gt;. The long term counts. It counts a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not suggesting we ignore our current problems to only look at the future; one of the best ways of improving the future is by improving the present. But we shouldn’t be so quick to dismiss projects simply because they won’t come to fruition in our lifetimes. Nor should we dismiss a suggestion just because it “feels wrong”. In the past, organ transplants, pacemakers, and even &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis#Conflict_with_established_medical_opinions&quot; title=&quot;Ignaz Semmelweis - Conflict with established medical opinions (Wikipedia)&quot;&gt;washing your surgical instruments after performing an autopsy&lt;/a&gt; “felt wrong”. For many people today, the thought same-sex intercourse &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; “feels wrong”. The human brain is apt to &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; disgust and unease at things which are ethically very &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like more people to think how they can make the world—and the future—a better place. To do that, I need them to think about—and often question—their own beliefs. I delight when I find someone who supports their beliefs with evidence, and who accepts counter-evidence that may falsify their beliefs. These are people who are interested in the truth; and the truth is real whether you “believe” in it or not. These are the same people with whom discussing ethics is a delight, since they’re apt to establish a method of analysis that asks “what harm does this cause, and what benefits does it bring?” rather than to simply declare “it feels wrong” or “it feels right”. These are the people that most often have me question and change my own beliefs, and I love them dearly for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, our default wiring isn’t set that way, and it’s not hard to see why. If someone sacrifices their child to save the lives of a hundred others, that person is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to be universally praised; nor are they likely to even feel good about themselves. Yet if we put value on human lives, then clearly saving the lives of a hundred children is superior to saving just one, even if we feel deeply uncomfortable with the scenario posed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this brings me to my problem. I would like others to think about things rationally; in terms of harm and benefit, in terms of what overall good can be achieved in the world. I would like people to think about their ethical beliefs, and to question &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they feel that way, and whether that’s actually for the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, I would like for people to be more &lt;em&gt;aware&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, in itself, is a hard problem. Ignorance is not only comforting, but it’s strengthening. If a person believes that same-sex marriage is wrong, or that we should turn refugees away from our borders, or that people with different coloured skin are inferior, then that person is unlikely to wish to consider evidence. A naive attempt to present them with evidence may even cause them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactance_(psychology)&quot; title=&quot;Reactance (Wikipedia)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;strengthen&lt;/em&gt; their beliefs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s a deeper problem for me personally, one that makes &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; feel uneasy. Living in a little bubble, being unaware of the injustices of the world, being unaware of how one contributes to those injustices… it’s &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt;. Making people more &lt;em&gt;aware&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t make them more &lt;em&gt;happy&lt;/em&gt;; in fact it often does the reverse. Even if someone says they want to know the truth, even if they say they want to learn how to better question themselves and the world, learning the truth has potential to do personal harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s for this reason that I will leave someone’s religious beliefs alone, yet still argue passionately that condoms and sex education are a good idea. It’s for this reason I’ll accept the racist comments of a dying person with sympathy and support, yet pointedly question those same beliefs in a healthy individual. If someone has great power to enact change and make the world a better place—but insists on doing the reverse—then I will argue to the limits of what I consider ethical to try and change that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you find me questioning your beliefs—if you find me trying to change your mind—it means that I feel that you have both the intelligence to change, and the capacity to make the world a better place if you do so. If I’m trying to convince you that you’re wrong, then I’m most assuredly paying you a compliment. And if you’re able to change my own beliefs in the process, then I will be delighted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
