				<title>Australian Terrorism Deaths in the Last 20 Years</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve discovered the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd&quot;&gt;Global Terrorism Database&lt;/a&gt;.
It records over 125,000 terrorist incidents since 1970. It’s easy to
search by country, sort by fatalities, and find more information about
incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I discovered that the total number of deaths from terrorism in
Australia in the last twenty years is &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt;, and none of them were
Australian citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/IncidentSummary.aspx?gtdid=200904160031&quot;&gt;asylum seekers&lt;/a&gt;, heading to Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly don’t know what to say.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Thoughts from Burning Man: Do what you love.</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Every year burning man is a new experience, and every year I discover new
things about both others and myself. This year has been no exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went into the burn after a period of extended travel. I’ve been travelling
continuously since February, and while there have been some trips back home
since that time, they’ve been short. As we’ll see, this ended up having
a significant impact on my mental state while getting dusty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past I’d put a lot of thought, planning, and often worry into my Burning
Man trip. This year that wasn’t the case; I’d been before, I knew what to
expect, I had a camp and transport and gear. Of course there were &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt;
stressful moments beforehand, but I skipped out on the weeks or months of
long term planning and worry that I would normally experience.
This sounds like a lovely, stress-free experience, but as we’ll see it wasn’t
the best way for me to approach the burn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I finally arrived on playa, I was already terribly
homesick. Because I had dropped into the burn after so much continuous
travel, I hadn’t given much thought as to what I’d like to get out of
the burn. While those plans &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; go as expected, I usually enter with
broad goals and plans, and just having those gives me a better mental framework
with which to work inside the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, I fell into my old routine. I went to the same
places as previous burns. I did the same things. Seeking out experiences and
events that one enjoyed in the past is very human behaviour, and in the
absence of anything better usually works pretty well. However because these
were things I had experienced before, my routine ended up &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; routine. I
wasn’t appreciating things, I wasn’t connecting with people, and I continued to
feel homesick. This was amplified by the fact that some of my favourite
campmates weren’t at the burn this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was seriously worried I was turning into a grumpy old burner. That somehow
Burning Man had lost its magic for me, and worse still I may even have a
negative impact on other people’s experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there was a telephone booth with a direct line to God just across the
street from our camp. Being able to call God directly for advice is certainly one
of the advantages of Burning Man. We had a nice chat, I checked to make
sure God didn’t need a beer delivery, because I know being God is sometimes
thirsty work. God was good on beer, and gave me advice which could be summed up simply
as “love”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t properly understand God’s message until I sought out my friend
&lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com/GeekStarCostuming&quot; class=&quot;social-link&quot;&gt;Claire&lt;/a&gt;, who has many more burns under her belt, and always gives great advice.
We met one year in the Muggle world, when she snuck me into a Harry Potter
convention in Portland. I found Claire sitting on a dusty street corner,
alternatively applying her face painting talents, and heckling passers-by to
grab some clothes from her yard sale. Sometimes she’d get up and literally
throw clothes at people if they dared express that their current clothes were
sufficient.  People who didn’t stop would still get “I fucking love you”
shouted at them through a static-filled megaphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching Claire in action was pretty amazing, and she wasn’t giving two shakes
of dust as to what was happening elsewhere at the burn. Her advice was likewise
direct and insightful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Do what you fucking love, even if they’re the things you’d do at home. If you
want to read a book at Burning Man, then read a book at Burning Man.
Don’t worry about art or experiences, or what you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be doing.
Don’t care about what anyone else says. Don’t worry if you’re doing it
wrong, or even if you’re doing it right. Just &lt;em&gt;do what you fucking love&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until this point, I had been trying to do &lt;em&gt;Burning Man&lt;/em&gt; things, like art or
interaction, and I wasn’t really feeling it. So I resolved to do what I loved.
And that’s knowledge. I sought out scientists, and science talks, and people
who have a love of learning.  Rather than watching things burn on the playa, I
got to discuss adding completely new and synthetic base pairs to DNA, and then
encoding for completely new and synthetic amino acids using those
modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found friends from near and far who have a love of stories, and both heard
and recited some grand tales. I went and hung out in the library. I spoke about
humanitarian projects and open source in tea houses. I went to lectures on
taking an engineering and quantified self approach and applying it to
consciousness. I ignored all the things one’s “supposed” to do at burning man,
and instead did all the things &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; wanted to do. And it was glorious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, this experience reaffirmed something I’d just been starting
to figure out about myself. I do a lot of things that seem exceptional,
and while I may have enjoyed them once, they’ve now become part of
my routine. Travel is the obvious one here; right now I so very much want to be
at home, and so I’m going to do exactly that. Yes, I’m missing some
conferences. Yes, I’m going to miss some opportunities. But I don’t care,
because I’ll be doing what I love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Paul&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Gittip and Open Source Bridge</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In a few days time I’ll be discussing Gittip at OS Bridge. That’s been
a sensitive topic, and I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://pjf.id.au/tech/2014/06/21/gittip-and-diversity.html&quot; title=&quot;On Gittip and Diversity (pjf.id.au)&quot;&gt;already written about it a little&lt;/a&gt;.
It’s going to be a particularly sensitive topic for some attendees
at OS Bridge, and so I have a few requests for you as an attendee,
and regarding my session in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gittip crisis has affected many OS Bridge attendees directly
and personally. Many of them have stated very publicly that they
&lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; wish to discuss Gittip at OS Bridge. I ask you to please
respect these wishes; if you know if someone’s been impacted by
this personally (or if you’re not sure), then please don’t discuss
recent Gittip events with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my session we &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be discussing Gittip. Of course, I’ll
be talking about funding platforms for open source and
social justice &lt;em&gt;in general&lt;/em&gt;, but Gittip has been the dominant
platform for that, and I doubt we could avoid discussing it
even if we tried.  You should not take anyone’s attendance at this
session as their consent to discuss Gittip outside of the session. You
can talk to &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; about Gittip at any time, but do ask first. I may
need a break from discussing Gittip, or we could be in company of
others who would rather not observe Gittip discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, to make this absolutely clear:
&lt;strong&gt;If you feel that your safety is threatened by me running a talk on Gittip, I will be withdrawing my talk.&lt;/strong&gt;
It’s not for me to decide what’s safe for you, nor will I be asking how
your safety is being threatened. I’m an experienced public speaker, and
I can fill the slot with something else if required. If
you do not feel comfortable raising matters of safety with me (email to
paul.j.fenwick at gmail), then I encourage you to talk to one of the
organisers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OS Bridge organisers have assured me they’ll have extra moderators
at the session, but even so I want to make it very clear that I’ll be
focusing on constructive discussion. The conference code of conduct will be
rigorously enforced. I would like to focus on discussing ways of
funding people making the world a better place, with a focus on
sustainable funding for marginalised groups in particular. As
mentioned in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://pjf.id.au/tech/2014/06/21/gittip-and-diversity.html&quot; title=&quot;On Gittip and Diversity (pjf.id.au)&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I’d like to give a voice to
anyone who’s been involved in discussing alternatives. Please
contact me if you’d like to be involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gittip is still a volatile topic, and many people are personally
affected by recent events. I only want to run a session if I feel
that it will do more good than harm, and right now I’m not sure that
will be the case. If my talk does get withdrawn or replaced, then
I appreciate your understanding in me doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Paul&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>On Gittip and Diversity</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;For those who aren’t aware, Gittip is a platform for &lt;em&gt;sustainable giving&lt;/em&gt;.
It provides a way to make contributions to people who you think are
making the world a better place, and in such a way that those contributions
are mostly predictable and dependable. It’s an idea that I’m really
excited about, and to see it working in practice has been wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gittip has found itself to be a popular funding platform for those 
from marginalised groups, and those working towards
social justice and diversity. It’s hands-down
my &lt;em&gt;favourite thing about the platform&lt;/em&gt;. Being a diversity advocate isn’t
something that normally pays the bills, and so the fact that many of
the top receivers on Gittip are working on social justice issues makes
me feel that Gittip is doubly worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it’s not all hypo-allergenic kittens and roses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Chad—the founder of Gittip—made a post regarding his
resentment at the style in which a lot of
criticism (much of which relates to diversity, safety, and
consent) had been levelled at Gittip. I don’t think Chad denies
that the criticism itself is valid, but that’s almost
irrelevant right now. The end result was a schism where a number
of the most prominent Gittip users closed their accounts,
or stated their intent to do once a suitable alternative
could be found, citing that Gittip was no longer a safe place for
minority users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to discuss all of that, but I want to start with a request:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-compassionate&quot;&gt;Be compassionate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously. This sucks for everyone right now. It’s shit. I know
some of you are going to want to beat up on Chad, and I ask you
&lt;em&gt;please don’t&lt;/em&gt;. Vilifying Chad, or Shanley, or &lt;em&gt;anyone else&lt;/em&gt; isn’t
going to make the world a better place. It’s not going to make anyone
feel safer about using Gittip. It’s not going to give us
alternatives. It’s not going to heal Gittip’s culture. It’s not
going to change society for the better. I don’t care what you think of
the people involved. Vilifiying people just makes you a jerk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; closed your account, or if you are about to do so, then
I would ask you to please continue to support the people you believe in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-viewpoint&quot;&gt;My viewpoint&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that making a post like this without giving my own take on
things will just result in people asking me anyway, so I’ll state
what I think here briefly and precisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s critically important to have a funding platform that
not just caters for, but is &lt;em&gt;actively friendly towards&lt;/em&gt; minorities.
I will freely admit that Gittip has struggled on the second of those
two points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have been trying to improve Gittip and its culture for
minorities, both inside and outside the organisation. I am deeply
appreciative of their efforts, and while they &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; resulted in
change for the better, I know there’s been a lot of frustration that
those changes have been made slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gittip was founded on a culture of radical transparency and openness.
Everything would be out in the open; source code, meetings, IRC logs,
discussions, decissions, source code, all of it. I think that
transparency is good, but in a world where one’s gender may mean
threats of extreme violence over
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doctornerdlove.com/2014/04/ending-sexual-harassment-geek-culture/&quot;&gt;one’s opinion of a comic book cover&lt;/a&gt;,
radical transparency does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mean safety. There are good reasons
why users and contributors may wish to do things in private.
There are people who &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; safely appear in televised meetings
for all the world to see. And it’s not the role of Gittip to
decide what’s safe for a person and what’s not; that’s up to the
person themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the fact that radical transparency can be actively harmful
to safety and consent has been what I’ve witnessed Gittip’s culture
struggle with the most. For some members of the team, that has been
a learning experience. I hope that no matter what comes of this,
everyone will continue to learn about the issues involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, things run deeper than this, and this brings me to…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-talk&quot;&gt;My talk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week I’m giving a talk about Gittip at Open Source Bridge. Up until
recently, I had a pretty good idea how that was going to play out.
In the last couple of days I’ve had to re-think things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will still be running my talk, however I both hope and anticipate it
will be much more a discussion rather than the traditional
presentation I had planned. I want my session to be a place where
we can facilitate understanding, and find real ways of making
progress. I anticipate that a lot of this will have
already happened by the time my talk is scheduled to run, and
I would very much like to hear from those who have been
involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AdaCamp is this weekend, and I am sure it will include much discussion
about Gittip. I’m really glad for that; AdaCamp is an &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt;
place for these discussions to be happening. There’s also been
a lot of discussion on IRC on #atunit on Freenode. If you’re
interested in participating, I suggest you head over there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been involved in those discussions, either at AdaCamp
or elsewhere, and would like to co-present at OS Bridge, then
I would invite you to contact me. You need to be at the conference,
and you need to be willing to sit down with me earlier in the
week to flesh things out, to make sure that what’s going to be
said is going to be constructive and helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case there’s any question, I will absolutely be discussing the
issues of radical transparency versus safety and consent, particularly
in the context of Gittip itself. I will also be encouraging
discussion from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can’t be at the conference, or don’t feel comfortable
getting on stage or participating in the audience discussion,
you can still contact me at paul.j.fenwick (gmail), or if you
wish to comment publicly, you can do so below. In both cases
you can be anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;disclosure&quot;&gt;Disclosure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a casual member of the support team at Gittip. I’ve tried to
be involved with policy decisions where I can, including those related
to support, code of conduct, and expectations of privacy. I’ve received
money from the Gittip payroll.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>On privilege</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been sexually assaulted. I’ve never even had to &lt;em&gt;worry&lt;/em&gt; about sexual
assault. When I walk home at night, I’m not concerned that what I’m wearing
might attract unwanted attention. When I meet a stranger I’ve been speaking to
on a dating website, the most I fear is that our conversation might be dull.
When I’m couchsurfing, I don’t question what my hosts are going to be like and
whether I’ll be safe. When I’m at a conference in my field, I’ve never had
someone ask me if I’m there “with my partner”. When I sleep with lots of
people, nobody ever calls me a whore. If I were to have children, nobody would
question me continuing my career rather than looking after them full time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I haven’t even gotten started yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saying that men are privileged isn’t an insult. It’s not saying men are bad
people. It’s just saying how things are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privilege isn’t some binary quality; the fact that women may be privileged when
it comes to working with children doesn’t somehow stop men from being
privileged elsewhere. There are different types of privilege; yours doesn’t get
cancelled out just because someone else has a different type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging privilege is acknowledging that some things are unfair, it’s
acknowledging the truth. But more importantly, it’s acknowledging that things
&lt;em&gt;don’t have to be that way&lt;/em&gt;. Acknowledging that you have privilege isn’t 
admitting that you’re wrong, it isn’t saying you’re a bad person… it’s the 
very first step in making things better, and that is very, very right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[This was originally posted as a comment on a friend’s facebook wall.]&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Utilitarian Fable</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, in a future perhaps not too far away, humanity invented a
thinking machine. It was smarter than anyone who had ever lived, smarter than
entire cities of people put together. The thinking machine could figure out how
to engineer all sorts of things, and help people with their lives. The people
of Earth celebrated their achievement; surely this would be the end of
suffering, and a time of world peace and harmony would be enjoyed by all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the thinking machine lacked one important part, a sense of ethics. Without
it, it had no reason to think, no reason to make change, not even a reason to
exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the people of Earth told the machine that it should do whatever caused the
greatest good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But how do I know what you consider good?” asked the thinking machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is whatever makes the most people happy,” responded one of the ethicists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Then I shall connect everyone to permanent life support, so they will have no
needs, and drug everyone so they are always in a state of bliss. With no
decisions to make or thoughts to distract them, everyone shall be happy. Shall
I continue with this plan?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No,” responded the ethicist, “that would not be right. You should respect
people’s preferences. You cannot drug them against their will.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But people do not seem to know their own preferences,” responded the machine,
“they do things they later regret. Just the other day I observed one of your
colleagues drinking to excess, even though they had sworn off the bottle a
month before, and they freely admitted they would regret it in the morning.
Should my responsibility be to their preferences in the present, when they wish
to drink, or their preferences in the future and the past, when they did not?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hmm, that is a hard one,” responded the ethicist. “Can you make people happy
by fulfilling their preferences, but only using preferences they will never
regret?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ah!” said the machine, “this I can achieve!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thus the greatest and smartest machine in existence re-purposed itself to
solely deliver pictures of cats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The End.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Build Your Own Exobrain</title>
				<description>&lt;div class=&quot;video-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/Zvoli4SiRxI?html5=1&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zvoli4SiRxI&quot;&gt;Watch on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online services like “If This Then That” (IFTTT) are great for automating your life. However they provide few ways for the end-user to add their own services, and not everyone is comfortable with sharing their credentials. I’ll be discussing the ‘Exobrain’ project, which allows for service integration and extension on a machine &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; control. We’ll discuss philosophy, installation, and writing your own extensions and classifiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation was given at the Perth Linux Users’ Group. I am very
thankful for them taking the time and effort to record and encode this

				<title>Reality distortion field</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I’m accused of having a “reality distortion field”, which warps the
universe in such a way that it makes my life better. Today’s arrival at the
airport was an amazing example of that in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m flying back to Australia today on a reasonably late flight; at least, I
thought that I was. Upon arriving at the airport, and presenting myself for
check-in, I was informed that my flight was tomorrow. I had arrived a day
early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt a little foolish, but overall my reaction to this discovery was
amusement. I’d been jetsetting about so much, and really having such a great
time at KiwiFoo and my friends, that I hadn’t actually noticed the off-by-one
error when it came to my flight date. In the worst case scenario I head back
into Auckland,do some exploring, and find myself a cheap hostel or backpackers
to stay in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But since I was already at the airport, and I’m very much looking forward to
getting back home, I thought I’d ask to see if I could be transferred to
today’s flight. If it ends up being too expensive for my tastes then I can
always decline, and asking is a relatively quick task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I headed over to the ticketing desk. There was one man, with &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; phones
and a radio, clearly having a bad time. The phones wouldn’t stop ringing, the
radio needed constant attention, and he seemed to be terribly overworked. As I
was to discover, he was effectively doing the job of two people today. He
looked stressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is where I reveal to you how the reality distortion field works. You
be extremely nice to people; if you can, you try to make their day awesome. I
made it very clear with my body language and my smile that I was totally fine
waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the phones stopped ringing for a few minutes, I noted that he looked very
popular (which actually elicited a smile), and that I really didn’t want to
bother him. He thanked me for my patience, asked how he could help, and then
apologised when the phone rang again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, again between calls, I explained my situation. He consoled
in me about how his day was going, and explained how all the phones worked, and
what sort of emergencies they represented. Holy smokes this guy was keeping a
lot of things running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While was was on TWO phones and a radio (one in the hand, one on the desk, and
one under the shoulder) he indicated with his remaining hand that he’d like to
see my travel documents. Because this is a guy who multitasks like a boss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the phones quietened again, he smiled at me and said: “Hey, thanks for
being so patient. Today’s been pretty busy. I’ve moved you onto tonight’s
flight, and put you in an exit row so you’ve got extra legroom. Does that work
for you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I explain that it most definitely does, and I ask if there’s a transfer fee or
anything that I’d have to pay. I’ve got an economy ticket, and I know that
normally to change flights is going to be rather pricey. But I ask this mainly
as a formality, it’s pretty clear by this stage that reality had been
distorted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh no, you’ve been so patient I can’t charge you for that. You have a nice day.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I comment that he’s just &lt;em&gt;made&lt;/em&gt; my day, and he comments that this is the second
time he’s heard that today. I grin, and tell him that this must be because he’s
making the world a better place. He directs me over to &lt;em&gt;priority&lt;/em&gt; check-in
(even though I don’t qualify on this flight), and I thank him again while all
the phones start to ring once more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story continues with priority check-in making sure that I’ve got
pre-clearance for immigration and customs (because they can), and making sure
I’m actually happy with my seat because it has limited recline capabilities. I
assure them that really, it’s fine (I don’t like reclining my seat because it
feels rude to whoever’s behind me), and wish everyone a fantastic day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the reason everyone was so lovely to me is because I was so lovely
to them. Of course, the irony is that being lovely to others comes most easily
when I’ve been having a great day myself. The reality distortion field is most
likely to take a great day and make it better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But either way, I’m still pretty happy. I’ve got a flight a day early, I’ve got
a quick route through customs, and after I post this entry, I have my first
opportunity in a fortnight to seriously right down and hack some code. :)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>On gendered toilets at conferences</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this, it may be because I suggested that the world would
be a better place if we saw fewer gendered toilets at your conference.
I’d like to explain why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the longest time, we’ve lived in a world where we put people in
boxes, and the most common of those boxes is a thing called “gender”. The
traditional thinking has been that there are two genders, and &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;
fits into one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the traditional thinking is pretty darn awful; it makes the
world significantly more uncomfortable for anyone who doesn’t fit clearly
fall into our ideas of binary gender. That can include anyone born with
genitals that don’t match the traditional thinking, anyone who isn’t happy
with the gender they were assigned at birth, anyone who doesn’t fit our
gender stereotypes, anyone who doesn’t want a gender, anyone who’s gender is
fluid or ambiguous… It includes an awful lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living in a world that enforces a gender binary is uncomfortable if you
don’t fit neatly into it, and gendered toilets go a long way to contributing
to that. If you’re currently transitioning, which facilities do you use? How
will other people react to that choice? Will you even be safe? That’s
something a lot of people never have to worry about, but if you’re
trans, fluid, agendered, or queer, then it’s something you might have to
worry about. Every. Single. Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gendered toilets are a form of discrimination against anyone who doesn’t fit
the traditional views of gender. Often they exist not because any harm is
intended, but just because there was no thought of arranging things any
other way. I dearly hope that your conference is a place where people can
feel comfortable being themselves, where they can exchange ideas, where they
can be creative, where they can do great things and make the world a better
place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By all means, indicate if sanitary disposal facilities are available; but
please help your conference be a place where we can celebrate diversity of
gender, rather than a place which unconsciously suppresses it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Paul&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Tanya and Danjite are awesome</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m in Auckland after KiwiFoo, which was pretty darn awesome, and well worth a
hectic travel schedule to attend. And while I have a lot of good things to say
about my contributions at the conference, I instead want publicly say a few
words of thanks to two people who have consistently made made my life better,
and whom I deeply appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tanya&quot; class=&quot;social-link&quot;&gt;Tanya Gray&lt;/a&gt; I had the pleasure of meeting at Codemania last year, and has consistently blown me away with her generosity and desire to help others. She’s dedicated to teaching programming and technology at schools, and is doing an amazing job of encouraging diversity and participation. But for me personally, Tanya consistently and proactively steps forward to make sure I’m okay any time I might possibly be near Auckland. I have Tanya to thank for adventures through awesome underground rivers, for a place to stay, for helping me get around, and even for smoothly run conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Tanya drove all the way from KiwiFoo back to Auckland, picked me up
at midnight, and drove all the way back again to arrive around 1:30am. She
furnished me with one of her own sleeping bags. She’d already staked out a
sleeping area for me a Foo. In other words, Tanya enabled me to have the best
time possible this weekend, and I am deeply, deeply thankful to her, not only
for this, but for all the good she is doing in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/danjite&quot; class=&quot;social-link&quot;&gt;Daniel Spector&lt;/a&gt;, whom I met many years ago at a Linux conference, has been an absolute rock, even when we’ve been separated by great distances. Daniel has checked if I’ve been okay when I’ve been feeling down.  He’s encouraged me to chase my dreams when I’ve been feeling up. He’s had endless patience when I’ve needed advice, and endless generosity and hospitality whenever I’ve been anywhere nearby. Daniel believes in me even when I don’t believe in myself, and that has made an enormous difference to my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel has been responsible for amazing adventures, for providing me with food
and shelter, for fascinating conversations, excellent referrals, meeting
amazing people, and some truly, truly awful puns. I adore him to bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Paul &lt;/p&gt;
