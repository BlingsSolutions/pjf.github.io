				<title>CKAN needs an infrastructure sponsor!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;About six months ago I had this crazy idea that one of my favourite games, Kerbal Space Program, needed a mod manager that did everything &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;, and an &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; team of volunteers, including myself, set about to make that happen. The result has been the Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (CKAN). Tens of thousands of people have downloaded the CKAN client, and we index hundreds of mods to make sure our users can install and upgrade mods with the click of a button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CKAN has been an &lt;em&gt;overwhelming&lt;/em&gt; success. All our code is free, all our metadata is free, and all the work has been done by unpaid volunteers who wanted to contribute to something awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the CKAN requires infrastructure to run… and that’s not free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the services provided by the CKAN is the hosting of dedicated mirrors. These protect our users from outages, and ensure that mods which allow redistribution don’t suddenly cease-to-be if the site hosting them disappears. In December, each mirror required about 5GB of space. Now, due to our continued success, it’s about 20GB. However that’s only mirroring the latest version of each mod; we’d &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to mirror older versions as well, for players running on older versions of KSP, or players who need to backgrade because they’ve encountered a bug in a new mod release. We also have much more modest requirements for our build and continuous-integration server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, those infrastructure costs are being borne by the same volunteers who contribute to the CKAN, in particular Alexander Dzhoganov (aka nlight) who has been managing the infrastructure, as well as being project lead for much of 2015. Alexander is an &lt;em&gt;absolute hero&lt;/em&gt; for doing this, but the growing popularity of the project is rapidly making this unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so this is where you &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; come in. If you happen to work for a company that can provision us an instance with some 400GB of storage on a fast pipe, the potential for a few hundred gigabytes of traffic each month, and the willingness to grow with our needs, then we’ll think you’re &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;, and you’ll have saved the CKAN mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our first mirror and most important mirror we need an instance we can configure and run ourselves. We have bots that index all the mods, test everything installs, watches the git repo for changes, and provide amazing continuous integration tests. That instance is our main automation workhorse, it simply can’t work unless we can control it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the first mirror is re-homed, we can establish more traditional mirrors, and I’m thankful for everyone who’s offered to help out with these thus far. Those offers really do help, and I’ll be following up with everyone who’s made them, but the first mirror that lets us run our own virtual machine is most vital to our immediate needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your company &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; help, then please drop me an email at paul.j.fenwick at gmail, or you can tweet to me &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pjf&quot; class=&quot;social-link&quot;&gt;@pjf&lt;/a&gt;. We would &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you all so very much, and thank you in particular to all our amazing CKAN volunteers who have contributed to this success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Paul&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(CKAN Project Founder)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Why non-code contributions matter</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Contributing to open source projects is often considered to be a good career move. Unlike doing work behind the closed doors of a proprietary business, contributions to open source provides visible proof of your skill and accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except that’s not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often the most visible contributions are &lt;em&gt;code&lt;/em&gt;. There’s an endless number of tools to graph, visualise, plot, and examine &lt;em&gt;code&lt;/em&gt; contributions. But software projects are not just code. The people who are doing user experience design and feedback isn’t coding. The people who are building a thriving community isn’t coding. The people triaging bugs, supporting the users, organising events, brainstorming ideas, acting as liaisons, and writing documentation are not coding. The people who notice when someone’s burning out and provide support; the people reminding contributors that they’re valued and doing a good job; the very people who are critical for the long term health of the project aren’t coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And often, they’re forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a poor situation for everyone involved. A lack of recognition means these vital people may leave the project, much to its detriment. The same lack of recognition means open source is not always a good career move, even when the work has been outstanding. It’s easy to see code metrics, but it’s much harder to point to non-code contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something we need to fix. Non-code contributions come from a diverse range of backgrounds, much more diverse than code contributions. This means a lack of recognition is doubly bad for open source, not only are we failing to support vital contributions, but we’re also impeding diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leslie Hawthorn has written a brilliant piece on this¹, that goes into more detail, with better explanations than what I’ve written here. If you’re at all involved in open source, you should read it now. Most importantly, Leslie also provides a solution, and one that really should be obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acknowledge non-code contributions. Not just on mailing lists and support trackers, but in employer-visible locations such as LinkedIn, and across wider audiences such as social media. Leslie calls this “building the hat-rack”, although you’ll need to &lt;a href=&quot;http://hawthornlandings.org/2015/02/13/a-place-to-hang-your-hat/&quot;&gt;read her post&lt;/a&gt; to understand why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, I’m doing to do that right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish to say a very public thank you to Michele Ippolito, better known as “Ippo” in the Kerbal modding community. As some of you know, I started the CKAN project, a mod manager for Kebal Space Program. The CKAN has dozens of contributors, and has been a great success, and Ippo has been absolutely instrumental as part of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Ippo has a coding background, he’s been the linchpin of the CKAN &lt;em&gt;community&lt;/em&gt;. Ippo has spent countless hours liaising with mod authors, answering user queries, triaging bugs, writing documentation, maintaining the wiki, and making releases. If it were not for Ippo’s efforts, the CKAN simply wouldn’t be the resounding success that it is today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re involved in open source, or any field where contributions may go unacknowledged, I urge you to read Leslie’s post now and help acknowledge the amazing work that’s going on about you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With many thanks to everyone who’s building the future,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Paul #&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23LABHR&quot;&gt;LABHR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Why &quot;Ban the Burqa&quot; Doesn't Hold</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;[TW: Discusses religious intolerance, and violence against women.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You, or someone you know, may make the argument that the burqa—a traditional
full-body, face-covering article of women’s clothing—should be banned or
discouraged because it oppresses women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not interested in debating whether or not it oppresses women or not; but I
can tell you that calling for its ban &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; harming Australian women, right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably noticed there’s been quite a bit of Islamophobia recently. Of
course, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; believe in religious freedom, and you’re definitely not a racist.
Your stance on the burqa is only because you believe in gender equality, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there seem to be lots of people out there with bigoted views. I
won’t link to it, but the “ban the burqa” page on Facebook is nothing but
racial and religious intolerance and hatred. I couldn’t find anything about it
existing to promote equal rights for women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s the problem, by saying that you think the burqa should banned, it’s
&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; easy to think you’re a hateful bigot, because they’re the sort of people
who are really getting behind this. By saying you feel the burqa should be
banned, It’s very easy to think you’re against &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; sort of islamic
head-covering, even something as simple as a scarf. And it doesn’t even matter
if you say that you actually care about gender equality, because all the
racists and bigots out there will know that you’re secretly on their side.
They’ll feel that you justify their hatred. They’ll feel you’re &lt;em&gt;one of them&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s worse, by doing this, you fuel hatred towards the very women you are
trying to help. The level of Islamaphobia in Australia right now is both
horrible and completely unjustified, and by expressing these views you’re
increasing the hate and aggression suffered by perfectly innocent, law-abiding
women &lt;em&gt;who just want to go about their lives&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re trying to be an ally, you’re being the shittiest ally ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what can you do? Well, if you &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; care about gender equality, then
you should get out there and talk about &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;. Working towards gender equality
improves our society &lt;em&gt;for everyone&lt;/em&gt;. Argue that women &lt;em&gt;in general&lt;/em&gt; should be
free to wear &lt;em&gt;whatever they want&lt;/em&gt;, be that a burqa or a mini-skirt,
&lt;em&gt;without fear of violence&lt;/em&gt;. Argue that we should have greater funding for
survivors of domestic and sexual abuse. Argue that we should have greater
education opportunities, and &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; for disadvantaged and marginalised
groups; education is one of the greatest changes one can take towards removing
oppression of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, go forth and &lt;em&gt;be a feminist&lt;/em&gt;. You don’t have to use that
label, but if you’re truly trying to improve gender equality, then take
steps towards doing that &lt;em&gt;for everyone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But please, don’t go about saying we should ban an article of women’s clothing.
It makes &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; look like a bigot, and it only harms the very women you’re
trying to protect.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Thoughts from Burning Man: Do what you love.</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Every year burning man is a new experience, and every year I discover new
things about both others and myself. This year has been no exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went into the burn after a period of extended travel. I’ve been travelling
continuously since February, and while there have been some trips back home
since that time, they’ve been short. As we’ll see, this ended up having
a significant impact on my mental state while getting dusty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past I’d put a lot of thought, planning, and often worry into my Burning
Man trip. This year that wasn’t the case; I’d been before, I knew what to
expect, I had a camp and transport and gear. Of course there were &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt;
stressful moments beforehand, but I skipped out on the weeks or months of
long term planning and worry that I would normally experience.
This sounds like a lovely, stress-free experience, but as we’ll see it wasn’t
the best way for me to approach the burn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I finally arrived on playa, I was already terribly
homesick. Because I had dropped into the burn after so much continuous
travel, I hadn’t given much thought as to what I’d like to get out of
the burn. While those plans &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; go as expected, I usually enter with
broad goals and plans, and just having those gives me a better mental framework
with which to work inside the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, I fell into my old routine. I went to the same
places as previous burns. I did the same things. Seeking out experiences and
events that one enjoyed in the past is very human behaviour, and in the
absence of anything better usually works pretty well. However because these
were things I had experienced before, my routine ended up &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; routine. I
wasn’t appreciating things, I wasn’t connecting with people, and I continued to
feel homesick. This was amplified by the fact that some of my favourite
campmates weren’t at the burn this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was seriously worried I was turning into a grumpy old burner. That somehow
Burning Man had lost its magic for me, and worse still I may even have a
negative impact on other people’s experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there was a telephone booth with a direct line to God just across the
street from our camp. Being able to call God directly for advice is certainly one
of the advantages of Burning Man. We had a nice chat, I checked to make
sure God didn’t need a beer delivery, because I know being God is sometimes
thirsty work. God was good on beer, and gave me advice which could be summed up simply
as “love”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t properly understand God’s message until I sought out my friend
&lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com/GeekStarCostuming&quot; class=&quot;social-link&quot;&gt;Claire&lt;/a&gt;, who has many more burns under her belt, and always gives great advice.
We met one year in the Muggle world, when she snuck me into a Harry Potter
convention in Portland. I found Claire sitting on a dusty street corner,
alternatively applying her face painting talents, and heckling passers-by to
grab some clothes from her yard sale. Sometimes she’d get up and literally
throw clothes at people if they dared express that their current clothes were
sufficient.  People who didn’t stop would still get “I fucking love you”
shouted at them through a static-filled megaphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching Claire in action was pretty amazing, and she wasn’t giving two shakes
of dust as to what was happening elsewhere at the burn. Her advice was likewise
direct and insightful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Do what you fucking love, even if they’re the things you’d do at home. If you
want to read a book at Burning Man, then read a book at Burning Man.
Don’t worry about art or experiences, or what you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be doing.
Don’t care about what anyone else says. Don’t worry if you’re doing it
wrong, or even if you’re doing it right. Just &lt;em&gt;do what you fucking love&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until this point, I had been trying to do &lt;em&gt;Burning Man&lt;/em&gt; things, like art or
interaction, and I wasn’t really feeling it. So I resolved to do what I loved.
And that’s knowledge. I sought out scientists, and science talks, and people
who have a love of learning.  Rather than watching things burn on the playa, I
got to discuss adding completely new and synthetic base pairs to DNA, and then
encoding for completely new and synthetic amino acids using those
modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found friends from near and far who have a love of stories, and both heard
and recited some grand tales. I went and hung out in the library. I spoke about
humanitarian projects and open source in tea houses. I went to lectures on
taking an engineering and quantified self approach and applying it to
consciousness. I ignored all the things one’s “supposed” to do at burning man,
and instead did all the things &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; wanted to do. And it was glorious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, this experience reaffirmed something I’d just been starting
to figure out about myself. I do a lot of things that seem exceptional,
and while I may have enjoyed them once, they’ve now become part of
my routine. Travel is the obvious one here; right now I so very much want to be
at home, and so I’m going to do exactly that. Yes, I’m missing some
conferences. Yes, I’m going to miss some opportunities. But I don’t care,
because I’ll be doing what I love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Paul&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Gittip and Open Source Bridge</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In a few days time I’ll be discussing Gittip at OS Bridge. That’s been
a sensitive topic, and I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://pjf.id.au/tech/2014/06/21/gittip-and-diversity.html&quot; title=&quot;On Gittip and Diversity (pjf.id.au)&quot;&gt;already written about it a little&lt;/a&gt;.
It’s going to be a particularly sensitive topic for some attendees
at OS Bridge, and so I have a few requests for you as an attendee,
and regarding my session in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gittip crisis has affected many OS Bridge attendees directly
and personally. Many of them have stated very publicly that they
&lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; wish to discuss Gittip at OS Bridge. I ask you to please
respect these wishes; if you know if someone’s been impacted by
this personally (or if you’re not sure), then please don’t discuss
recent Gittip events with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my session we &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be discussing Gittip. Of course, I’ll
be talking about funding platforms for open source and
social justice &lt;em&gt;in general&lt;/em&gt;, but Gittip has been the dominant
platform for that, and I doubt we could avoid discussing it
even if we tried.  You should not take anyone’s attendance at this
session as their consent to discuss Gittip outside of the session. You
can talk to &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; about Gittip at any time, but do ask first. I may
need a break from discussing Gittip, or we could be in company of
others who would rather not observe Gittip discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, to make this absolutely clear:
&lt;strong&gt;If you feel that your safety is threatened by me running a talk on Gittip, I will be withdrawing my talk.&lt;/strong&gt;
It’s not for me to decide what’s safe for you, nor will I be asking how
your safety is being threatened. I’m an experienced public speaker, and
I can fill the slot with something else if required. If
you do not feel comfortable raising matters of safety with me (email to
paul.j.fenwick at gmail), then I encourage you to talk to one of the
organisers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OS Bridge organisers have assured me they’ll have extra moderators
at the session, but even so I want to make it very clear that I’ll be
focusing on constructive discussion. The conference code of conduct will be
rigorously enforced. I would like to focus on discussing ways of
funding people making the world a better place, with a focus on
sustainable funding for marginalised groups in particular. As
mentioned in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://pjf.id.au/tech/2014/06/21/gittip-and-diversity.html&quot; title=&quot;On Gittip and Diversity (pjf.id.au)&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I’d like to give a voice to
anyone who’s been involved in discussing alternatives. Please
contact me if you’d like to be involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gittip is still a volatile topic, and many people are personally
affected by recent events. I only want to run a session if I feel
that it will do more good than harm, and right now I’m not sure that
will be the case. If my talk does get withdrawn or replaced, then
I appreciate your understanding in me doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Paul&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>On Gittip and Diversity</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;For those who aren’t aware, Gittip is a platform for &lt;em&gt;sustainable giving&lt;/em&gt;.
It provides a way to make contributions to people who you think are
making the world a better place, and in such a way that those contributions
are mostly predictable and dependable. It’s an idea that I’m really
excited about, and to see it working in practice has been wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gittip has found itself to be a popular funding platform for those 
from marginalised groups, and those working towards
social justice and diversity. It’s hands-down
my &lt;em&gt;favourite thing about the platform&lt;/em&gt;. Being a diversity advocate isn’t
something that normally pays the bills, and so the fact that many of
the top receivers on Gittip are working on social justice issues makes
me feel that Gittip is doubly worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it’s not all hypo-allergenic kittens and roses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Chad—the founder of Gittip—made a post regarding his
resentment at the style in which a lot of
criticism (much of which relates to diversity, safety, and
consent) had been levelled at Gittip. I don’t think Chad denies
that the criticism itself is valid, but that’s almost
irrelevant right now. The end result was a schism where a number
of the most prominent Gittip users closed their accounts,
or stated their intent to do once a suitable alternative
could be found, citing that Gittip was no longer a safe place for
minority users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to discuss all of that, but I want to start with a request:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-compassionate&quot;&gt;Be compassionate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously. This sucks for everyone right now. It’s shit. I know
some of you are going to want to beat up on Chad, and I ask you
&lt;em&gt;please don’t&lt;/em&gt;. Vilifying Chad, or Shanley, or &lt;em&gt;anyone else&lt;/em&gt; isn’t
going to make the world a better place. It’s not going to make anyone
feel safer about using Gittip. It’s not going to give us
alternatives. It’s not going to heal Gittip’s culture. It’s not
going to change society for the better. I don’t care what you think of
the people involved. Vilifiying people just makes you a jerk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; closed your account, or if you are about to do so, then
I would ask you to please continue to support the people you believe in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-viewpoint&quot;&gt;My viewpoint&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that making a post like this without giving my own take on
things will just result in people asking me anyway, so I’ll state
what I think here briefly and precisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s critically important to have a funding platform that
not just caters for, but is &lt;em&gt;actively friendly towards&lt;/em&gt; minorities.
I will freely admit that Gittip has struggled on the second of those
two points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have been trying to improve Gittip and its culture for
minorities, both inside and outside the organisation. I am deeply
appreciative of their efforts, and while they &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; resulted in
change for the better, I know there’s been a lot of frustration that
those changes have been made slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gittip was founded on a culture of radical transparency and openness.
Everything would be out in the open; source code, meetings, IRC logs,
discussions, decissions, source code, all of it. I think that
transparency is good, but in a world where one’s gender may mean
threats of extreme violence over
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doctornerdlove.com/2014/04/ending-sexual-harassment-geek-culture/&quot;&gt;one’s opinion of a comic book cover&lt;/a&gt;,
radical transparency does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mean safety. There are good reasons
why users and contributors may wish to do things in private.
There are people who &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; safely appear in televised meetings
for all the world to see. And it’s not the role of Gittip to
decide what’s safe for a person and what’s not; that’s up to the
person themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the fact that radical transparency can be actively harmful
to safety and consent has been what I’ve witnessed Gittip’s culture
struggle with the most. For some members of the team, that has been
a learning experience. I hope that no matter what comes of this,
everyone will continue to learn about the issues involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, things run deeper than this, and this brings me to…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-talk&quot;&gt;My talk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week I’m giving a talk about Gittip at Open Source Bridge. Up until
recently, I had a pretty good idea how that was going to play out.
In the last couple of days I’ve had to re-think things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will still be running my talk, however I both hope and anticipate it
will be much more a discussion rather than the traditional
presentation I had planned. I want my session to be a place where
we can facilitate understanding, and find real ways of making
progress. I anticipate that a lot of this will have
already happened by the time my talk is scheduled to run, and
I would very much like to hear from those who have been
involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AdaCamp is this weekend, and I am sure it will include much discussion
about Gittip. I’m really glad for that; AdaCamp is an &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt;
place for these discussions to be happening. There’s also been
a lot of discussion on IRC on #atunit on Freenode. If you’re
interested in participating, I suggest you head over there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been involved in those discussions, either at AdaCamp
or elsewhere, and would like to co-present at OS Bridge, then
I would invite you to contact me. You need to be at the conference,
and you need to be willing to sit down with me earlier in the
week to flesh things out, to make sure that what’s going to be
said is going to be constructive and helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case there’s any question, I will absolutely be discussing the
issues of radical transparency versus safety and consent, particularly
in the context of Gittip itself. I will also be encouraging
discussion from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can’t be at the conference, or don’t feel comfortable
getting on stage or participating in the audience discussion,
you can still contact me at paul.j.fenwick (gmail), or if you
wish to comment publicly, you can do so below. In both cases
you can be anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;disclosure&quot;&gt;Disclosure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a casual member of the support team at Gittip. I’ve tried to
be involved with policy decisions where I can, including those related
to support, code of conduct, and expectations of privacy. I’ve received
money from the Gittip payroll.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>On privilege</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been sexually assaulted. I’ve never even had to &lt;em&gt;worry&lt;/em&gt; about sexual
assault. When I walk home at night, I’m not concerned that what I’m wearing
might attract unwanted attention. When I meet a stranger I’ve been speaking to
on a dating website, the most I fear is that our conversation might be dull.
When I’m couchsurfing, I don’t question what my hosts are going to be like and
whether I’ll be safe. When I’m at a conference in my field, I’ve never had
someone ask me if I’m there “with my partner”. When I sleep with lots of
people, nobody ever calls me a whore. If I were to have children, nobody would
question me continuing my career rather than looking after them full time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I haven’t even gotten started yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saying that men are privileged isn’t an insult. It’s not saying men are bad
people. It’s just saying how things are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privilege isn’t some binary quality; the fact that women may be privileged when
it comes to working with children doesn’t somehow stop men from being
privileged elsewhere. There are different types of privilege; yours doesn’t get
cancelled out just because someone else has a different type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging privilege is acknowledging that some things are unfair, it’s
acknowledging the truth. But more importantly, it’s acknowledging that things
&lt;em&gt;don’t have to be that way&lt;/em&gt;. Acknowledging that you have privilege isn’t 
admitting that you’re wrong, it isn’t saying you’re a bad person… it’s the 
very first step in making things better, and that is very, very right.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Utilitarian Fable</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, in a future perhaps not too far away, humanity invented a
thinking machine. It was smarter than anyone who had ever lived, smarter than
entire cities of people put together. The thinking machine could figure out how
to engineer all sorts of things, and help people with their lives. The people
of Earth celebrated their achievement; surely this would be the end of
suffering, and a time of world peace and harmony would be enjoyed by all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the thinking machine lacked one important part, a sense of ethics. Without
it, it had no reason to think, no reason to make change, not even a reason to
exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the people of Earth told the machine that it should do whatever caused the
greatest good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But how do I know what you consider good?” asked the thinking machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is whatever makes the most people happy,” responded one of the ethicists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Then I shall connect everyone to permanent life support, so they will have no
needs, and drug everyone so they are always in a state of bliss. With no
decisions to make or thoughts to distract them, everyone shall be happy. Shall
I continue with this plan?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No,” responded the ethicist, “that would not be right. You should respect
people’s preferences. You cannot drug them against their will.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But people do not seem to know their own preferences,” responded the machine,
“they do things they later regret. Just the other day I observed one of your
colleagues drinking to excess, even though they had sworn off the bottle a
month before, and they freely admitted they would regret it in the morning.
Should my responsibility be to their preferences in the present, when they wish
to drink, or their preferences in the future and the past, when they did not?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hmm, that is a hard one,” responded the ethicist. “Can you make people happy
by fulfilling their preferences, but only using preferences they will never
regret?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ah!” said the machine, “this I can achieve!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thus the greatest and smartest machine in existence re-purposed itself to
solely deliver pictures of cats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The End.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online services like “If This Then That” (IFTTT) are great for automating your life. However they provide few ways for the end-user to add their own services, and not everyone is comfortable with sharing their credentials. I’ll be discussing the ‘Exobrain’ project, which allows for service integration and extension on a machine &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; control. We’ll discuss philosophy, installation, and writing your own extensions and classifiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation was given at the Perth Linux Users’ Group. I am very
thankful for them taking the time and effort to record and encode this
video.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Reality distortion field</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I’m accused of having a “reality distortion field”, which warps the
universe in such a way that it makes my life better. Today’s arrival at the
airport was an amazing example of that in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m flying back to Australia today on a reasonably late flight; at least, I
thought that I was. Upon arriving at the airport, and presenting myself for
check-in, I was informed that my flight was tomorrow. I had arrived a day
early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt a little foolish, but overall my reaction to this discovery was
amusement. I’d been jetsetting about so much, and really having such a great
time at KiwiFoo and my friends, that I hadn’t actually noticed the off-by-one
error when it came to my flight date. In the worst case scenario I head back
into Auckland,do some exploring, and find myself a cheap hostel or backpackers
to stay in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But since I was already at the airport, and I’m very much looking forward to
getting back home, I thought I’d ask to see if I could be transferred to
today’s flight. If it ends up being too expensive for my tastes then I can
always decline, and asking is a relatively quick task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I headed over to the ticketing desk. There was one man, with &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; phones
and a radio, clearly having a bad time. The phones wouldn’t stop ringing, the
radio needed constant attention, and he seemed to be terribly overworked. As I
was to discover, he was effectively doing the job of two people today. He
looked stressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is where I reveal to you how the reality distortion field works. You
be extremely nice to people; if you can, you try to make their day awesome. I
made it very clear with my body language and my smile that I was totally fine
waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the phones stopped ringing for a few minutes, I noted that he looked very
popular (which actually elicited a smile), and that I really didn’t want to
bother him. He thanked me for my patience, asked how he could help, and then
apologised when the phone rang again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, again between calls, I explained my situation. He consoled
in me about how his day was going, and explained how all the phones worked, and
what sort of emergencies they represented. Holy smokes this guy was keeping a
lot of things running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While was was on TWO phones and a radio (one in the hand, one on the desk, and
one under the shoulder) he indicated with his remaining hand that he’d like to
see my travel documents. Because this is a guy who multitasks like a boss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the phones quietened again, he smiled at me and said: “Hey, thanks for
being so patient. Today’s been pretty busy. I’ve moved you onto tonight’s
flight, and put you in an exit row so you’ve got extra legroom. Does that work
for you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I explain that it most definitely does, and I ask if there’s a transfer fee or
anything that I’d have to pay. I’ve got an economy ticket, and I know that
normally to change flights is going to be rather pricey. But I ask this mainly
as a formality, it’s pretty clear by this stage that reality had been
distorted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh no, you’ve been so patient I can’t charge you for that. You have a nice day.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I comment that he’s just &lt;em&gt;made&lt;/em&gt; my day, and he comments that this is the second
time he’s heard that today. I grin, and tell him that this must be because he’s
making the world a better place. He directs me over to &lt;em&gt;priority&lt;/em&gt; check-in
(even though I don’t qualify on this flight), and I thank him again while all
the phones start to ring once more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story continues with priority check-in making sure that I’ve got
pre-clearance for immigration and customs (because they can), and making sure
I’m actually happy with my seat because it has limited recline capabilities. I
assure them that really, it’s fine (I don’t like reclining my seat because it
feels rude to whoever’s behind me), and wish everyone a fantastic day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the reason everyone was so lovely to me is because I was so lovely
to them. Of course, the irony is that being lovely to others comes most easily
when I’ve been having a great day myself. The reality distortion field is most
likely to take a great day and make it better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But either way, I’m still pretty happy. I’ve got a flight a day early, I’ve got
a quick route through customs, and after I post this entry, I have my first
opportunity in a fortnight to seriously right down and hack some code. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Paul &lt;/p&gt;
