				<title>It's time we spoke about loneliness</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Okay folks, it’s time to talk about mental health again. Today we’re going to be discussing one of the most common and yet stigma-laden topics of all: loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people feel lonely. An estimated 20% of the United States population experiences loneliness, and amongst groups prone to social isolation that can be much, much higher. Loneliness isn’t just unpleasant, either; it’s associated with a mortality risk about equal to that of smoking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if there’s one thing we don’t like to admit, it’s that we’re lonely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loneliness comes with a whole barrel of stigmas associated with it. Saying that you’re lonely can make you feel like a failure, and comes with the real concern that others will feel the same. Loneliness can make you less effective at everything, which means it’s easy to find evidence for your fears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, loneliness can have nothing to do with popularity, or number of friends. You can have an active social life and still be lonely. When Stephen Fry battled with depression, he said that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stephenfry.com/2013/06/24/only-the-lonely/&quot;&gt;loneliness was the worst part&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lonely? I get invitation cards through the post almost every day. I shall be in the Royal Box at Wimbledon and I have serious and generous offers from friends asking me to join them in the South of France, Italy, Sicily, South Africa, British Columbia, and America this summer. I have two months to start a book before I go off to Broadway for a run of Twelfth Night there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I can read back that last sentence and see that, bipolar or not, if I’m under treatment and not actually depressed, what the fuck right do I have to be lonely, unhappy, or forlorn? I don’t have the right. But there again I don’t have the right not to have those feelings. Feelings are not something to which one does or does not have rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the end loneliness is the most terrible and contradictory of my problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, loneliness can &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; social aversion; highly social people will wall themselves up and hide from the world when they’re lonely. Many studies have found that loneliness increases the aversion to close human contact, even when we know that’s what we need. It’s easy to feel one can be a drag, or won’t fit in, or worst of all rejection: that your fear that nobody wants to spend time with you is actually real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s been a lot of studies between social media and loneliness. We know there’s a correlation between loneliness and social media, but we don’t know if there’s causality; it would make sense for lonely people to spend more time in a social medium, even if it can be questioned if that medium provides the sort of close interpersonal interactions that can make a difference to loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because this is something with so much stigma associated with it, because this is something that we hate to admit to ourselves (let alone others), I’m going to say this straight: I’m lonely. Not always, not all the time, but often enough. It gets in the way of my work. It turns me into a recluse. It certainly gets in the way of me being the person that I want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if this comes as a surprise, then I’ve done my hiding well. When I’m socialising with others, I’m usually &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; lonely. If I’m talking about how I’ve been, then loneliness is the &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; thing I want to mention, because saying that genuinely makes me feel that I’ve failed. But the moment other people are gone, then more often than not the feeling of loneliness returns, and I’ll hide away from the world as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a cry for help, nor a request for assistance. It is a refusal to remain quiet despite the stigmas we have when discussing mental health. It’s me saying “hey, it’s not just you”, for as much good as that will do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to offer advice, I don’t even think my advice may be worth that much, but I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; tell you that loneliness is extremely common as well as extremely hidden. No matter what you may think, you are not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>I've pledged to give 10% of my income to causes that do the most good</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, 16th August I made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge&quot; title=&quot;Giving What We Can Pledge&quot;&gt;pledge&lt;/a&gt;. A lifelong pledge to give 10% of my income to causes that do the most good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something I should have done a long time ago, and for years I had found excuses not to do so. I was saving for a house. I was building financial security. It wasn’t &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; fault that injustice and hardship existed elsewhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is. It’s totally my fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food I eat is transported and grown with petroleum products which &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hrw.org/africa/equatorial-guinea&quot;&gt;support corrupt regimes&lt;/a&gt; that keep people in poverty. The electricity that powers my laptop, the trains that I catch, and the public lighting I enjoy, comes from environmental destruction and greenhouse gas emission. The animal products I use are the result of cruelty and suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal choices can lessen the negative impact I make on the world, but no amount of being car-free or using green energy will eliminate the damage I’m causing. But there is something I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do. I can take responsibility. I can try to make amends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in one of the richest countries on Earth. I have financial, health, housing, and food security. I have valuable and transferrable skills. I’ve had &lt;a href=&quot;http://thewireless.co.nz/articles/the-pencilsword-on-a-plate&quot;&gt;opportunities&lt;/a&gt; that much of the world’s population—even those here in Australia—simply never had. At a relatively small cost to me I can make a large difference elsewhere, and I feel it is my moral obligation to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most effective charities in the world are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; effective. 200 &lt;em&gt;million&lt;/em&gt; people suffer from malaria each year, and of those, up to 800,000 will die. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), 500 people die &lt;em&gt;per day&lt;/em&gt;, the vast majority of which are children under five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you know what stops malaria? Bed-nets. Treated with insecticide, these not only protect the people they’re distributed to, but they kill the mosquitoes that spread disease, protecting the entire community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of distributing a net in the DRC—one of the most difficult places in the world to work—is about $7.50 USD, inclusive of all expenses, which include follow-up studies to ensure correct deployment and use. For every thousand children protected with nets, 5.5 lives are saved¹.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost-per-life-saved is a little higher than one may get from naive calculations; not every net is used effectively, nets need to be replaced over time, and there are other factors at play. &lt;a href=&quot;http://givewell.org/&quot;&gt;GiveWell&lt;/a&gt; estimates a cost of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF#Costperlifesaved&quot;&gt;just under $3,500 USD per life saved&lt;/a&gt;. Through lifelong giving I have the opportunity to impact &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; lives, and to do genuine good in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure I remain committed to this pledge, Thomas Hendrey has pledged with me, and we’ll be checking each other’s progress each year. But I would also like &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; to join me in doing good. Even if you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/try-giving&quot;&gt;pledge just 1%&lt;/a&gt; of your income for a year, that’s a real diffence that can be made. I’ve chosen to do this in conjunction with &lt;a href=&quot;https://givingwhatwecan.org/&quot;&gt;Giving What We Can&lt;/a&gt;, as they provide tracking and support for pledgers, but I am also personally willing to provide social support in helping you keep that pledge. One of my biggest psychological barriers was finding other people to join me in doing good.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Human relevance in the age of machines</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The industrial revolution’s defining feature was the mass-production of machines that could do jobs &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than human workers. This was a change so profound that British Parliament passed a law in 1812 making &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_of_Stocking_Frames,_etc._Act_1812&quot;&gt;destruction of a robot worker a &lt;em&gt;capital offence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While that law no longer exists, there still exists an ongoing and relevant concern that humans will be replaced with machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the focus is on machines replacing human labour, resulting in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_unemployment&quot;&gt;technological unemployment&lt;/a&gt;; but I’m concerned about something much more frightening: what if machines can do &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; better than humans? What if they’re not only better workers, but better authors, better artists, better chefs, and better lovers? What happens when the machines can offer us anything we want… &lt;a href=&quot;http://dresdencodak.com/2008/06/07/eloi/&quot;&gt;save relevance&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relevance is a fascinating term, and as a species we have &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; struggled it. Religion, work, family, conflict, exploration, hardship, art, justice, discovery… all these things have given us relevance throughout the generations, and what gives our own lives relevance varies from person to person. The idea that employment gives our life relevance is certainly advantageous for a capitalist society, but it’s also clear that for many people employment makes them feel &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; relevant: it takes them away from the things they truly love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, relevance is supplied purely by “artificial” factors; I’ve seen people go to great lengths working on their characters in massively multiplayer games, and it’s very clear these people find relevance in doing so. I’ve met people who find relevance in knowing the contents of a book or movie extremely well, even though they are the audience and not the creator. I persist in dabbling in calligraphy and writing, even though it’s abundantly clear that I’m not the best at these, nor will ever be the best. I don’t expect these to have relevance beyond the smallest of groups, and yet that act of creation gives my own life relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to the humanity of the future gives me a newfound appreciation of &lt;em&gt;art&lt;/em&gt;, for art may be undertaken for art’s sake alone. Few people build a megastructure in Minecraft expecting to make money from it, but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; art and it provides purpose nonetheless. Few teenagers write terrible poetry truly expecting it to change the world, or even with the expectation of showing it to others; but—if my own history is anything to go by—teenagers will continue write terrible poetry, and it will be relevant to &lt;em&gt;themeselves&lt;/em&gt; nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The joy of creation is a joy that exists even though other people can do the same thing better, even though one’s skills may still be fledgling, and even if that creation doesn’t change the world in ways society tells us are important. The act of creation as a gift remains a highly relevant social act; the cake you baked &lt;em&gt;yourself&lt;/em&gt; means more to your loved ones than the cake you purchased, even though the purchased cake is “better” in all other ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a future where machines are better at everything, I feel that humans will &lt;em&gt;continue&lt;/em&gt; to have relevance, for no other reason than because as a species we have &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; found ways to feel relevant in the face of ever-changing circumstances. Humans feel joy from learning, even when their discoveries are not new. Humans feel important in their social circles, even when their social circles are in no way extraordinary. Humans will continue to create and work towards goals, even when others have already achieved them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say that all humans will feel relevant in this future, but not all humans feel relevant &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;. In a world where machines are better at everything, they may be also be better &lt;em&gt;guides&lt;/em&gt;, helping humans to find a feeling of purpose and relevance in an otherwise uncaring universe; potentially transforming an uncaring universe into a caring one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s my big concern for the future; are the machines &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; create placed in a role that cares for humanity, or is indifferent to it? When it comes down to tough decisions, does your machine doctor seek to find diseases early so they can be treated early, or so your insurance agency can hike your premiums? Does your personal agent exist to ease the burdens of your day, or to maximise advertising revenue? Does your automated car seek to minimise accidents and harm, or does it seek to minimise legal exposure of its manufacturer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All those questions are relevant today, as all those technologies are &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; today, but the current answers are not ones that I feel comfortable with, and not ones which are best for the future of humanity. I am convinced more and more that we should not be afraid of the machines of the future, but the &lt;em&gt;systems&lt;/em&gt; which cause those machines to come into existence; for as long as we develop technology for profit and not the greater good, there will be a misalignment between the trajectory we are presently on, and the future that would provide humanity and its creations greater relevance than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Noirin</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I met Noirin at OSCON, many years ago. Actually, I think it was the community leadership summit before OSCON. I was being me—meeting everyone—and one of those people was Noirin. I don’t remember the conversation exactly, but they must have asked me what I was working on, because I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; remember giving them a presentation of my Ignite talk (which I was nervous about) and asking for feedback (which they very generously gave). That started a long tradition of Noirin giving me feedback on my talks; ones that I had done, ones that I was working on, ones that were just thoughts in my head. And as part of that process and the friendship that surrounded it, I discovered something wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way in which Noirin saw the world was beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noirin would send me letters about their day. Some of them would be the most trivial things, like a bus trip home from work, but they were described with such wonder and enthusiasm and joy that they were an absolute delight to read. They would describe the crunch of the leaves beneath their boots, the way in which the wind caught their hair, and the sun shining through the leaves of a tree. Letters from Noirin were magical, and I cherished them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noirin was always delighted with adventures. I remember exploring the tunnels under Melbourne and doing light-painting with them. I remember handing them a non-venomous jellyfish on a beach in Australia. I remember us being dressed as pirates, at a rooftop bar in Portland, and Noirin handing me a shot-glass of “chilli-infused midori” and watching—with a twinkle in their eye and a huge grin on their face—as I consumed a shot of &lt;em&gt;habanero lube&lt;/em&gt;. It remains the best prank anyone has ever played on me, and I appreciated it both now and back then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noirin was understanding and supportive in times when &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; had it hard. I remember when I was sad and worn out and not really sure what I was doing with my life, and Noirin would just check on me, no matter where I was in the world, to see how I was doing, to tell me jokes and stories, and to make sure I was feeling better as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember Noirin insisting I eat an enormous amount of food at thanksgiving. I remember Noirin insisting that I should have their camera, because I had recently discovered the joys of photography. I remember Noirin telling me that everyone in Ireland knew each other, and then meeting Diane while dressed as Santa on the other side of the world, and discovering Noirin’s insistence to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember having a really, really bad day, and Noirin telling me they had organised an Amanda Palmer concert, and that I should MC it because no matter how much &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; didn’t believe in myself at the time, &lt;em&gt;Noirin&lt;/em&gt; believed in me. It was one of the best days of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Noirin, for the memories, for the support, for the love, and for all the joy and wonder you brought not just into my life, but into the lives of those around you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love you, Noirin, rest in peace. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Past and Future CKAN</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been almost five months since the first version of the Comprehensive
Kerbal Archive Network (CKAN) was released. What started as a desire to
make it easier to install and manage Kerbal mods has now turned into a
system that’s used by tens of thousands of users, along with hundreds
of contributors to our metadata and code. The CKAN has been a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt;
success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, I posted saying that we were 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://pjf.id.au/tech/2015/03/12/ckan-infrastructure-sponsor-needed.html&quot;&gt;looking for an infrastructure sponsor&lt;/a&gt;
to help us with our growing needs, and I’m delighted to say that
search has been successful. We’re very grateful to 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/a&gt; for their ongoing support.
With the help of AWS, we’re not only ensuring that mods are indexed
quickly and our code is continuously tested, but we’re also mirroring
thousands of past and present mod releases. We’re looking forward to
future CKAN clients being faster and more reliable than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our biggest challenges at the moment are not technical, but instead
time pressures faced by many of our key contributors. All the CKAN
developers work on the project in their spare time, and we have some
outstandingly talented people. However that means they’re
also starting companies, running successful businesses, jumping out
of airplanes, or having rich and varied lives that compete for their
time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to ensure the continued development and support of the CKAN,
I’d like to move it out of the things I do when I have spare time,
and instead into the things I do as part of my job, with regular code
sprints, scheduled work days, progress reports, and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I run my own software consultancy, so having the CKAN as part of my
job is entirely possible, but it means turning down other projects to
make time for it. To see if this is possible, I’ve created a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://patreon.com/pjf0&quot;&gt;patreon page&lt;/a&gt; to support my CKAN
development efforts. I’ve already got co-working space and a huge
amount of coffee booked for the 12th April, so if we hit our first
funding milestone by that time, it will be the first CKAN sprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether we make the funding goals or not, I still intend
to work on the CKAN during my spare time as I always have. However if
successful I’m looking forward to being able to devote more and
regular hours to CKAN development and support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For everyone who has contributed to the project, &lt;em&gt;thank you&lt;/em&gt; for
helping make it the incredible success that it is today. It’s been
a pleasure working with you, and I look forward to doing even more of
the same in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to support me in developing the CKAN, or simply learn
more about my plans, please visit my
&lt;a href=&quot;https://patreon.com/pjf0&quot;&gt;patreon page&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Paul
(CKAN project founder)&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;About six months ago I had this crazy idea that one of my favourite games, Kerbal Space Program, needed a mod manager that did everything &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;, and an &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; team of volunteers, including myself, set about to make that happen. The result has been the Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (CKAN). Tens of thousands of people have downloaded the CKAN client, and we index hundreds of mods to make sure our users can install and upgrade mods with the click of a button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CKAN has been an &lt;em&gt;overwhelming&lt;/em&gt; success. All our code is free, all our metadata is free, and all the work has been done by unpaid volunteers who wanted to contribute to something awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the CKAN requires infrastructure to run… and that’s not free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the services provided by the CKAN is the hosting of dedicated mirrors. These protect our users from outages, and ensure that mods which allow redistribution don’t suddenly cease-to-be if the site hosting them disappears. In December, each mirror required about 5GB of space. Now, due to our continued success, it’s about 20GB. However that’s only mirroring the latest version of each mod; we’d &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to mirror older versions as well, for players running on older versions of KSP, or players who need to backgrade because they’ve encountered a bug in a new mod release. We also have much more modest requirements for our build and continuous-integration server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, those infrastructure costs are being borne by the same volunteers who contribute to the CKAN, in particular Alexander Dzhoganov (aka nlight) who has been managing the infrastructure, as well as being project lead for much of 2015. Alexander is an &lt;em&gt;absolute hero&lt;/em&gt; for doing this, but the growing popularity of the project is rapidly making this unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so this is where you &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; come in. If you happen to work for a company that can provision us an instance with some 400GB of storage on a fast pipe, the potential for a few hundred gigabytes of traffic each month, and the willingness to grow with our needs, then we’ll think you’re &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;, and you’ll have saved the CKAN mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our first mirror and most important mirror we need an instance we can configure and run ourselves. We have bots that index all the mods, test everything installs, watches the git repo for changes, and provide amazing continuous integration tests. That instance is our main automation workhorse, it simply can’t work unless we can control it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the first mirror is re-homed, we can establish more traditional mirrors, and I’m thankful for everyone who’s offered to help out with these thus far. Those offers really do help, and I’ll be following up with everyone who’s made them, but the first mirror that lets us run our own virtual machine is most vital to our immediate needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your company &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; help, then please drop me an email at paul.j.fenwick at gmail, or you can tweet to me &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pjf&quot; class=&quot;social-link&quot;&gt;@pjf&lt;/a&gt;. We would &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you all so very much, and thank you in particular to all our amazing CKAN volunteers who have contributed to this success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Paul&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Why non-code contributions matter</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Contributing to open source projects is often considered to be a good career move. Unlike doing work behind the closed doors of a proprietary business, contributions to open source provides visible proof of your skill and accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except that’s not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often the most visible contributions are &lt;em&gt;code&lt;/em&gt;. There’s an endless number of tools to graph, visualise, plot, and examine &lt;em&gt;code&lt;/em&gt; contributions. But software projects are not just code. The people who are doing user experience design and feedback isn’t coding. The people who are building a thriving community isn’t coding. The people triaging bugs, supporting the users, organising events, brainstorming ideas, acting as liaisons, and writing documentation are not coding. The people who notice when someone’s burning out and provide support; the people reminding contributors that they’re valued and doing a good job; the very people who are critical for the long term health of the project aren’t coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And often, they’re forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a poor situation for everyone involved. A lack of recognition means these vital people may leave the project, much to its detriment. The same lack of recognition means open source is not always a good career move, even when the work has been outstanding. It’s easy to see code metrics, but it’s much harder to point to non-code contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something we need to fix. Non-code contributions come from a diverse range of backgrounds, much more diverse than code contributions. This means a lack of recognition is doubly bad for open source, not only are we failing to support vital contributions, but we’re also impeding diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leslie Hawthorn has written a brilliant piece on this¹, that goes into more detail, with better explanations than what I’ve written here. If you’re at all involved in open source, you should read it now. Most importantly, Leslie also provides a solution, and one that really should be obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acknowledge non-code contributions. Not just on mailing lists and support trackers, but in employer-visible locations such as LinkedIn, and across wider audiences such as social media. Leslie calls this “building the hat-rack”, although you’ll need to &lt;a href=&quot;http://hawthornlandings.org/2015/02/13/a-place-to-hang-your-hat/&quot;&gt;read her post&lt;/a&gt; to understand why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, I’m doing to do that right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish to say a very public thank you to Michele Ippolito, better known as “Ippo” in the Kerbal modding community. As some of you know, I started the CKAN project, a mod manager for Kebal Space Program. The CKAN has dozens of contributors, and has been a great success, and Ippo has been absolutely instrumental as part of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Ippo has a coding background, he’s been the linchpin of the CKAN &lt;em&gt;community&lt;/em&gt;. Ippo has spent countless hours liaising with mod authors, answering user queries, triaging bugs, writing documentation, maintaining the wiki, and making releases. If it were not for Ippo’s efforts, the CKAN simply wouldn’t be the resounding success that it is today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re involved in open source, or any field where contributions may go unacknowledged, I urge you to read Leslie’s post now and help acknowledge the amazing work that’s going on about you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With many thanks to everyone who’s building the future,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Paul #&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23LABHR&quot;&gt;LABHR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Why &quot;Ban the Burqa&quot; Doesn't Hold</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;[TW: Discusses religious intolerance, and violence against women.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You, or someone you know, may make the argument that the burqa—a traditional
full-body, face-covering article of women’s clothing—should be banned or
discouraged because it oppresses women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not interested in debating whether or not it oppresses women or not; but I
can tell you that calling for its ban &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; harming Australian women, right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably noticed there’s been quite a bit of Islamophobia recently. Of
course, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; believe in religious freedom, and you’re definitely not a racist.
Your stance on the burqa is only because you believe in gender equality, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there seem to be lots of people out there with bigoted views. I
won’t link to it, but the “ban the burqa” page on Facebook is nothing but
racial and religious intolerance and hatred. I couldn’t find anything about it
existing to promote equal rights for women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s the problem, by saying that you think the burqa should banned, it’s
&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; easy to think you’re a hateful bigot, because they’re the sort of people
who are really getting behind this. By saying you feel the burqa should be
banned, It’s very easy to think you’re against &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; sort of islamic
head-covering, even something as simple as a scarf. And it doesn’t even matter
if you say that you actually care about gender equality, because all the
racists and bigots out there will know that you’re secretly on their side.
They’ll feel that you justify their hatred. They’ll feel you’re &lt;em&gt;one of them&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s worse, by doing this, you fuel hatred towards the very women you are
trying to help. The level of Islamaphobia in Australia right now is both
horrible and completely unjustified, and by expressing these views you’re
increasing the hate and aggression suffered by perfectly innocent, law-abiding
women &lt;em&gt;who just want to go about their lives&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re trying to be an ally, you’re being the shittiest ally ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what can you do? Well, if you &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; care about gender equality, then
you should get out there and talk about &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;. Working towards gender equality
improves our society &lt;em&gt;for everyone&lt;/em&gt;. Argue that women &lt;em&gt;in general&lt;/em&gt; should be
free to wear &lt;em&gt;whatever they want&lt;/em&gt;, be that a burqa or a mini-skirt,
&lt;em&gt;without fear of violence&lt;/em&gt;. Argue that we should have greater funding for
survivors of domestic and sexual abuse. Argue that we should have greater
education opportunities, and &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; for disadvantaged and marginalised
groups; education is one of the greatest changes one can take towards removing
oppression of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, go forth and &lt;em&gt;be a feminist&lt;/em&gt;. You don’t have to use that
label, but if you’re truly trying to improve gender equality, then take
steps towards doing that &lt;em&gt;for everyone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But please, don’t go about saying we should ban an article of women’s clothing.
It makes &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; look like a bigot, and it only harms the very women you’re
trying to protect.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Thoughts from Burning Man: Do what you love.</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Every year burning man is a new experience, and every year I discover new
things about both others and myself. This year has been no exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went into the burn after a period of extended travel. I’ve been travelling
continuously since February, and while there have been some trips back home
since that time, they’ve been short. As we’ll see, this ended up having
a significant impact on my mental state while getting dusty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past I’d put a lot of thought, planning, and often worry into my Burning
Man trip. This year that wasn’t the case; I’d been before, I knew what to
expect, I had a camp and transport and gear. Of course there were &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt;
stressful moments beforehand, but I skipped out on the weeks or months of
long term planning and worry that I would normally experience.
This sounds like a lovely, stress-free experience, but as we’ll see it wasn’t
the best way for me to approach the burn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I finally arrived on playa, I was already terribly
homesick. Because I had dropped into the burn after so much continuous
travel, I hadn’t given much thought as to what I’d like to get out of
the burn. While those plans &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; go as expected, I usually enter with
broad goals and plans, and just having those gives me a better mental framework
with which to work inside the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, I fell into my old routine. I went to the same
places as previous burns. I did the same things. Seeking out experiences and
events that one enjoyed in the past is very human behaviour, and in the
absence of anything better usually works pretty well. However because these
were things I had experienced before, my routine ended up &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; routine. I
wasn’t appreciating things, I wasn’t connecting with people, and I continued to
feel homesick. This was amplified by the fact that some of my favourite
campmates weren’t at the burn this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was seriously worried I was turning into a grumpy old burner. That somehow
Burning Man had lost its magic for me, and worse still I may even have a
negative impact on other people’s experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there was a telephone booth with a direct line to God just across the
street from our camp. Being able to call God directly for advice is certainly one
of the advantages of Burning Man. We had a nice chat, I checked to make
sure God didn’t need a beer delivery, because I know being God is sometimes
thirsty work. God was good on beer, and gave me advice which could be summed up simply
as “love”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t properly understand God’s message until I sought out my friend
&lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com/GeekStarCostuming&quot; class=&quot;social-link&quot;&gt;Claire&lt;/a&gt;, who has many more burns under her belt, and always gives great advice.
We met one year in the Muggle world, when she snuck me into a Harry Potter
convention in Portland. I found Claire sitting on a dusty street corner,
alternatively applying her face painting talents, and heckling passers-by to
grab some clothes from her yard sale. Sometimes she’d get up and literally
throw clothes at people if they dared express that their current clothes were
sufficient.  People who didn’t stop would still get “I fucking love you”
shouted at them through a static-filled megaphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching Claire in action was pretty amazing, and she wasn’t giving two shakes
of dust as to what was happening elsewhere at the burn. Her advice was likewise
direct and insightful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Do what you fucking love, even if they’re the things you’d do at home. If you
want to read a book at Burning Man, then read a book at Burning Man.
Don’t worry about art or experiences, or what you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be doing.
Don’t care about what anyone else says. Don’t worry if you’re doing it
wrong, or even if you’re doing it right. Just &lt;em&gt;do what you fucking love&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until this point, I had been trying to do &lt;em&gt;Burning Man&lt;/em&gt; things, like art or
interaction, and I wasn’t really feeling it. So I resolved to do what I loved.
And that’s knowledge. I sought out scientists, and science talks, and people
who have a love of learning.  Rather than watching things burn on the playa, I
got to discuss adding completely new and synthetic base pairs to DNA, and then
encoding for completely new and synthetic amino acids using those
modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found friends from near and far who have a love of stories, and both heard
and recited some grand tales. I went and hung out in the library. I spoke about
humanitarian projects and open source in tea houses. I went to lectures on
taking an engineering and quantified self approach and applying it to
consciousness. I ignored all the things one’s “supposed” to do at burning man,
and instead did all the things &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; wanted to do. And it was glorious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, this experience reaffirmed something I’d just been starting
to figure out about myself. I do a lot of things that seem exceptional,
and while I may have enjoyed them once, they’ve now become part of
my routine. Travel is the obvious one here; right now I so very much want to be
at home, and so I’m going to do exactly that. Yes, I’m missing some
conferences. Yes, I’m going to miss some opportunities. But I don’t care,
because I’ll be doing what I love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Paul&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Gittip and Open Source Bridge</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In a few days time I’ll be discussing Gittip at OS Bridge. That’s been
a sensitive topic, and I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://pjf.id.au/tech/2014/06/21/gittip-and-diversity.html&quot; title=&quot;On Gittip and Diversity (pjf.id.au)&quot;&gt;already written about it a little&lt;/a&gt;.
It’s going to be a particularly sensitive topic for some attendees
at OS Bridge, and so I have a few requests for you as an attendee,
and regarding my session in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gittip crisis has affected many OS Bridge attendees directly
and personally. Many of them have stated very publicly that they
&lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; wish to discuss Gittip at OS Bridge. I ask you to please
respect these wishes; if you know if someone’s been impacted by
this personally (or if you’re not sure), then please don’t discuss
recent Gittip events with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my session we &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be discussing Gittip. Of course, I’ll
be talking about funding platforms for open source and
social justice &lt;em&gt;in general&lt;/em&gt;, but Gittip has been the dominant
platform for that, and I doubt we could avoid discussing it
even if we tried.  You should not take anyone’s attendance at this
session as their consent to discuss Gittip outside of the session. You
can talk to &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; about Gittip at any time, but do ask first. I may
need a break from discussing Gittip, or we could be in company of
others who would rather not observe Gittip discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, to make this absolutely clear:
&lt;strong&gt;If you feel that your safety is threatened by me running a talk on Gittip, I will be withdrawing my talk.&lt;/strong&gt;
It’s not for me to decide what’s safe for you, nor will I be asking how
your safety is being threatened. I’m an experienced public speaker, and
I can fill the slot with something else if required. If
you do not feel comfortable raising matters of safety with me (email to
paul.j.fenwick at gmail), then I encourage you to talk to one of the
organisers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OS Bridge organisers have assured me they’ll have extra moderators
at the session, but even so I want to make it very clear that I’ll be
focusing on constructive discussion. The conference code of conduct will be
rigorously enforced. I would like to focus on discussing ways of
funding people making the world a better place, with a focus on
sustainable funding for marginalised groups in particular. As
mentioned in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://pjf.id.au/tech/2014/06/21/gittip-and-diversity.html&quot; title=&quot;On Gittip and Diversity (pjf.id.au)&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I’d like to give a voice to
anyone who’s been involved in discussing alternatives. Please
contact me if you’d like to be involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gittip is still a volatile topic, and many people are personally
affected by recent events. I only want to run a session if I feel
that it will do more good than harm, and right now I’m not sure that
will be the case. If my talk does get withdrawn or replaced, then
I appreciate your understanding in me doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Paul&lt;/p&gt;
