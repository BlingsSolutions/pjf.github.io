				<title>On privilege</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been sexually assaulted. I’ve never even had to &lt;em&gt;worry&lt;/em&gt; about sexual
assault. When I walk home at night, I’m not concerned that what I’m wearing
might attract unwanted attention. When I meet a stranger I’ve been speaking to
on a dating website, the most I fear is that our conversation might be dull.
When I’m couchsurfing, I don’t question what my hosts are going to be like and
whether I’ll be safe. When I’m at a conference in my field, I’ve never had
someone ask me if I’m there “with my partner”. When I sleep with lots of
people, nobody ever calls me a whore. If I were to have children, nobody would
question me continuing my career rather than looking after them full time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I haven’t even gotten started yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saying that men are privileged isn’t an insult. It’s not saying men are bad
people. It’s just saying how things are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privilege isn’t some binary quality; the fact that women may be privileged when
it comes to working with children doesn’t somehow stop men from being
privileged elsewhere. There are different types of privilege; yours doesn’t get
cancelled out just because someone else has a different type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging privilege is acknowledging that some things are unfair, it’s
acknowledging the truth. But more importantly, it’s acknowledging that things
&lt;em&gt;don’t have to be that way&lt;/em&gt;. Acknowledging that you have isn’t admitting that
you’re wrong, it isn’t saying you’re a bad person… it’s the very first step
in making things better, and that is very, very right.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Utilitarian Fable</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, in a future perhaps not too far away, humanity invented a
thinking machine. It was smarter than anyone who had ever lived, smarter than
entire cities of people put together. The thinking machine could figure out how
to engineer all sorts of things, and help people with their lives. The people
of Earth celebrated their achievement; surely this would be the end of
suffering, and a time of world peace and harmony would be enjoyed by all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the thinking machine lacked one important part, a sense of ethics. Without
it, it had no reason to think, no reason to make change, not even a reason to
exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the people of Earth told the machine that it should do whatever caused the
greatest good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But how do I know what you consider good?” asked the thinking machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is whatever makes the most people happy,” responded one of the ethicists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Then I shall connect everyone to permanent life support, so they will have no
needs, and drug everyone so they are always in a state of bliss. With no
decisions to make or thoughts to distract them, everyone shall be happy. Shall
I continue with this plan?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No,” responded the ethicist, “that would not be right. You should respect
people’s preferences. You cannot drug them against their will.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But people do not seem to know their own preferences,” responded the machine,
“they do things they later regret. Just the other day I observed one of your
colleagues drinking to excess, even though they had sworn off the bottle a
month before, and they freely admitted they would regret it in the morning.
Should my responsibility be to their preferences in the present, when they wish
to drink, or their preferences in the future and the past, when they did not?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hmm, that is a hard one,” responded the ethicist. “Can you make people happy
by fulfilling their preferences, but only using preferences they will never
regret?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ah!” said the machine, “this I can achieve!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thus the greatest and smartest machine in existence re-purposed itself to
solely deliver pictures of cats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The End.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online services like “If This Then That” (IFTTT) are great for automating your life. However they provide few ways for the end-user to add their own services, and not everyone is comfortable with sharing their credentials. I’ll be discussing the ‘Exobrain’ project, which allows for service integration and extension on a machine &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; control. We’ll discuss philosophy, installation, and writing your own extensions and classifiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation was given at the Perth Linux Users’ Group. I am very
thank for them taking the time and effort to record and encode this
video.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Reality distortion field</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I’m accused of having a “reality distortion field”, which warps the
universe in such a way that it makes my life better. Today’s arrival at the
airport was an amazing example of that in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m flying back to Australia today on a reasonably late flight; at least, I
thought that I was. Upon arriving at the airport, and presenting myself for
check-in, I was informed that my flight was tomorrow. I had arrived a day
early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt a little foolish, but overall my reaction to this discovery was
amusement. I’d been jetsetting about so much, and really having such a great
time at KiwiFoo and my friends, that I hadn’t actually noticed the off-by-one
error when it came to my flight date. In the worst case scenario I head back
into Auckland,do some exploring, and find myself a cheap hostel or backpackers
to stay in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But since I was already at the airport, and I’m very much looking forward to
getting back home, I thought I’d ask to see if I could be transferred to
today’s flight. If it ends up being too expensive for my tastes then I can
always decline, and asking is a relatively quick task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I headed over to the ticketing desk. There was one man, with &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; phones
and a radio, clearly having a bad time. The phones wouldn’t stop ringing, the
radio needed constant attention, and he seemed to be terribly overworked. As I
was to discover, he was effectively doing the job of two people today. He
looked stressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is where I reveal to you how the reality distortion field works. You
be extremely nice to people; if you can, you try to make their day awesome. I
made it very clear with my body language and my smile that I was totally fine
waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the phones stopped ringing for a few minutes, I noted that he looked very
popular (which actually elicited a smile), and that I really didn’t want to
bother him. He thanked me for my patience, asked how he could help, and then
apologised when the phone rang again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, again between calls, I explained my situation. He consoled
in me about how his day was going, and explained how all the phones worked, and
what sort of emergencies they represented. Holy smokes this guy was keeping a
lot of things running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While was was on TWO phones and a radio (one in the hand, one on the desk, and
one under the shoulder) he indicated with his remaining hand that he’d like to
see my travel documents. Because this is a guy who multitasks like a boss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the phones quietened again, he smiled at me and said: “Hey, thanks for
being so patient. Today’s been pretty busy. I’ve moved you onto tonight’s
flight, and put you in an exit row so you’ve got extra legroom. Does that work
for you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I explain that it most definitely does, and I ask if there’s a transfer fee or
anything that I’d have to pay. I’ve got an economy ticket, and I know that
normally to change flights is going to be rather pricey. But I ask this mainly
as a formality, it’s pretty clear by this stage that reality had been
distorted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh no, you’ve been so patient I can’t charge you for that. You have a nice day.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I comment that he’s just &lt;em&gt;made&lt;/em&gt; my day, and he comments that this is the second
time he’s heard that today. I grin, and tell him that this must be because he’s
making the world a better place. He directs me over to &lt;em&gt;priority&lt;/em&gt; check-in
(even though I don’t qualify on this flight), and I thank him again while all
the phones start to ring once more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story continues with priority check-in making sure that I’ve got
pre-clearance for immigration and customs (because they can), and making sure
I’m actually happy with my seat because it has limited recline capabilities. I
assure them that really, it’s fine (I don’t like reclining my seat because it
feels rude to whoever’s behind me), and wish everyone a fantastic day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the reason everyone was so lovely to me is because I was so lovely
to them. Of course, the irony is that being lovely to others comes most easily
when I’ve been having a great day myself. The reality distortion field is most
likely to take a great day and make it better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But either way, I’m still pretty happy. I’ve got a flight a day early, I’ve got
a quick route through customs, and after I post this entry, I have my first
opportunity in a fortnight to seriously right down and hack some code. :)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>On gendered toilets at conferences</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this, it may be because I suggested that the world would
be a better place if we saw fewer gendered toilets at your conference.
I’d like to explain why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the longest time, we’ve lived in a world where we put people in
boxes, and the most common of those boxes is a thing called “gender”. The
traditional thinking has been that there are two genders, and &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;
fits into one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the traditional thinking is pretty darn awful; it makes the
world significantly more uncomfortable for anyone who doesn’t fit clearly
fall into our ideas of binary gender. That can include anyone born with
genitals that don’t match the traditional thinking, anyone who isn’t happy
with the gender they were assigned at birth, anyone who doesn’t fit our
gender stereotypes, anyone who doesn’t want a gender, anyone who’s gender is
fluid or ambiguous… It includes an awful lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living in a world that enforces a gender binary is uncomfortable if you
don’t fit neatly into it, and gendered toilets go a long way to contributing
to that. If you’re currently transitioning, which facilities do you use? How
will other people react to that choice? Will you even be safe? That’s
something a lot of people never have to worry about, but if you’re
trans, fluid, agendered, or queer, then it’s something you might have to
worry about. Every. Single. Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gendered toilets are a form of discrimination against anyone who doesn’t fit
the traditional views of gender. Often they exist not because any harm is
intended, but just because there was no thought of arranging things any
other way. I dearly hope that your conference is a place where people can
feel comfortable being themselves, where they can exchange ideas, where they
can be creative, where they can do great things and make the world a better
place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By all means, indicate if sanitary disposal facilities are available; but
please help your conference be a place where we can celebrate diversity of
gender, rather than a place which unconsciously suppresses it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Paul&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Tanya and Danjite are awesome</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m in Auckland after KiwiFoo, which was pretty darn awesome, and well worth a
hectic travel schedule to attend. And while I have a lot of good things to say
about my contributions at the conference, I instead want publicly say a few
words of thanks to two people who have consistently made made my life better,
and whom I deeply appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tanya&quot; class=&quot;social-link&quot;&gt;Tanya Gray&lt;/a&gt; I had the pleasure of meeting at Codemania last year, and has consistently blown me away with her generosity and desire to help others. She’s dedicated to teaching programming and technology at schools, and is doing an amazing job of encouraging diversity and participation. But for me personally, Tanya consistently and proactively steps forward to make sure I’m okay any time I might possibly be near Auckland. I have Tanya to thank for adventures through awesome underground rivers, for a place to stay, for helping me get around, and even for smoothly run conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Tanya drove all the way from KiwiFoo back to Auckland, picked me up
at midnight, and drove all the way back again to arrive around 1:30am. She
furnished me with one of her own sleeping bags. She’d already staked out a
sleeping area for me a Foo. In other words, Tanya enabled me to have the best
time possible this weekend, and I am deeply, deeply thankful to her, not only
for this, but for all the good she is doing in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/danjite&quot; class=&quot;social-link&quot;&gt;Daniel Spector&lt;/a&gt;, whom I met many years ago at a Linux conference, has been an absolute rock, even when we’ve been separated by great distances. Daniel has checked if I’ve been okay when I’ve been feeling down.  He’s encouraged me to chase my dreams when I’ve been feeling up. He’s had endless patience when I’ve needed advice, and endless generosity and hospitality whenever I’ve been anywhere nearby. Daniel believes in me even when I don’t believe in myself, and that has made an enormous difference to my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel has been responsible for amazing adventures, for providing me with food
and shelter, for fascinating conversations, excellent referrals, meeting
amazing people, and some truly, truly awful puns. I adore him to bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Paul &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Why diversity in tech is so hard to achieve</title>
				<description>&lt;figure class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/tech/anna-facebook-post.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tech/anna-facebook-post.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This was originally made as a response to a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/paul.fenwick/posts/10152061360984611&quot;&gt;Facebook post&lt;/a&gt;
discussing diversity issues in tech.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna: I am a feminist who has attended and spoken at your events. I’m not familiar with the experiences which you’ve had in the past; I’ve not been involved with them, and so I am in no position to comment. I have absolutely no desire to ruin your reputation or spread rumours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I am perfectly happy to comment on things that I’ve personally observed, and to call you out when I feel that you’re being actively harmful to diversity, especially diversity in open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 7th March (give or take a timezone) you publicly posted¹ about a conference that catered specifically to a group that is under-represented in both IT and FOSS. Since I gave the OSCON 2013 closing keynote on the processes by which marginalised groups in tech remain marginalised (even when there’s absolutely no hostility or ill intent) I’d normally be delighted with any post that promotes diversity and outreach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that’s not what your post was about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, it was a post that belittled an already minority group. I’m not really fond of belittling anyone, but I’m especially not fond of it when it comes from a person in a position of power, such as a conference organiser. It’s even worse when &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; conference organiser joins in, which is exactly what happened here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not a member of that minority group going to ConFoo, but if I was, then after seeing your post I would be thinking twice. Given the public behaviour I’d seen of the conference organisers, I wouldn’t feel comfortable discussing my non-mainstream sexuality. I certainly wouldn’t feel comfortable discussing any work I’d done in promoting diversity. If I was working on technology that helped with issues specific to the minority in which I belonged, I’d be concerned that this too would somehow be belittled… and none of this has anything to do with any &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; hostility at the conference; all that’s needed is the perception that hostility will arise for someone to be silenced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s one of the biggest reasons why diversity is so hard to achieve. Speaking at a conference &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be about the tech. It &lt;em&gt;shouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; be about worrying if you’re going to be harassed, belittled, shunned, stared at, made fun of, or worse. Outreach is not playing favourites; outreach is simply saying: “Hey, there are others like you. That lack of diversity you see isn’t because the people here suck, that’s just a historical artefact.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outreach programmes are a &lt;em&gt;compliment&lt;/em&gt; to the communities from which they grow. If there’s an outreach programme for a certain technology, then enough of a minority group in that technology think that it’s worthwhile to introduces others to it. Toxic communities rarely result in outreach; their members just leave instead. But healthy, active communities result in healthy, active outreach programmes. That’s something that should be celebrated, not something that should be the butt of a joke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna, I know that you want it to just be about the tech³. I want exactly the same thing. I’m not going to ask you to go promoting outreach programmes, but if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want tech conferences to be about the tech, then I am going to ask you to stop making fun of the people and communities who are running those programmes. By all means, criticise conferences on their technical merits; but please don’t criticise a conference just because of the gender or sexuality of the people who attend them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Paul &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Exobrain setup is now even easier!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Exobrain is my collection of digital minions which help me run my life. They know
my goals, my location, my to-do list, and help me best plan what I’m doing, both
personally and professionally. Best of all, none of my data is revealed to third
parties, because I control all my agents, and all the code is open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve previously written about how to &lt;a href=&quot;/tech/2014/02/09/automate-your-life-with-exobrain.html&quot;&gt;automate your life with exobrain&lt;/a&gt;. Today,
I’m going to talk more about how to get started with an exobrain install. I want to
thank everyone who attended my talk at &lt;a href=&quot;http://confoo.ca/&quot; title=&quot;ConFoo conference&quot;&gt;Confoo.ca&lt;/a&gt; for their feedback
and suggestions, and especially everyone who attended the install-fest on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve previously tried to get Exobrain installed, you would have known it had
a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of dependencies. I’m very glad to say that we’re moving towards a system
where instead of getting &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; with Exobrain, you now only get the parts
you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than one huge distribution, we now have the Exobrain &lt;em&gt;core&lt;/em&gt;, which contains
the framework and supporting infrastructure, and &lt;em&gt;components&lt;/em&gt;, which allow you to
hook into individual services. Installing the core still requires you to walk
through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pjf/exobrain/#installation&quot;&gt;Exobrain install guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual components now only require a couple of commands to get up and running.
For example, you may install &lt;code&gt;Exobrain::Twitter&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Exobrain::Beeminder&lt;/code&gt; to
communicate with Twitter or &lt;a href=&quot;https://beeminder.com&quot; title=&quot;Quantify your goals with Beeminder&quot;&gt;Beeminder&lt;/a&gt; respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Components come with their own configuration code, which means there’s no more
digging through &lt;code&gt;.exobrainrc&lt;/code&gt; files. Here’s how you’d get started with Beeminder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cpanm Exobrain::Beeminder
$ exobrain setup Beeminder
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will launch an interactive process that will walk you through obtaining an
API key, and will even test to make sure it’s working. Once complete, the Beeminder
services show up as their own service group:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ubic status

exobrain.beeminder
    exobrain.beeminder.source       running (pid 30359)
    exobrain.beeminder.notify       running (pid 30378)
    exobrain.beeminder.sink         running (pid 30389)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we can see that the Beeminder component comes with three parts. For
any component, the “source” reads from that data source and emits measurement
packets onto the Exobrain bus. The “sink” reads intents from the bus,
and transmits them to the external service. In the case of the Beeminder
component, it also comes with a “notify” agent, which generates notifications
whenever a Beeminder data-point is updated (provided we have Beeminder
call-backs configured correctly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because each component is in their own status group, you can enable or disable
them easily with &lt;code&gt;ubic start exobrain.beeminder&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ubic stop exobrain.beeminder&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the hood, components provide a much cleaner way of writing agents,
with many components supplying roles which allow automatically handle connection
and configuration to services. They also open the door to writing your own
private components which can be updated inpdependently to the rest of Exobrain,
or which you can distribute to others!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The iOS SSL/TLS bug is worse than you think</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Holy smokes. So having looked at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/02/22/applebug.html&quot;&gt;actual code&lt;/a&gt; for this, the bug in iOS / OSX is &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; worse than described &lt;a href=&quot;http://gizmodo.com/why-apples-huge-security-flaw-is-so-scary-1529041062&quot;&gt;on gizmodo&lt;/a&gt;. The article is misleading when it says your home network is safe, it’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;. If I poison your DNS queries, compromise your home router (they’re &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; exploitable), have privileged access to the network infrastructure between you and what you’re connecting to, or all manner of other things, then I &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; your connection, and whatever data you send across it; credit card details, bank account logins, facebook passwords, all of it. If I hijack anything that’s doing a software update, then I may potentially own your device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, if you’re already logged into a website, I may even be able to steal your cookies and act as you without you even needing to enter a username and password at all. Seriously, this exploit really is about as bad as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two-factor auth will mitigate some, but not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the damage here. The only way to close this hole is to upgrade your vulnerable apple devices now. Please do this. Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; What am I saying? Two factor auth isn’t going to help you one damn bit. If you’ve just typed in your account number and password to your bank, &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; you’re going to supply me with your one-time password as well, &lt;em&gt;because you think it’s your bank asking for it&lt;/em&gt;, and your browser isn’t going to tell you otherwise. You’re going to supply it even if the bank texts it to your phone; in fact, that just makes the whole thing feel &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; legitimate. So please, really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; upgrade. Right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gizmodo.com/why-apples-huge-security-flaw-is-so-scary-1529041062&quot;&gt;Gizmodo article&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/02/22/applebug.html&quot;&gt;Code with discussion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CVE-2014-1266&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How I Claimed $270 of Beeminder Bounties</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Last Tuesday I paid &lt;a href=&quot;https://beeminder.com&quot; title=&quot;Quantify your goals with Beeminder&quot;&gt;Beeminder&lt;/a&gt; $5 because I didn’t floss my teeth
when I promised that I would. That evening, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; was the one collecting $270
from Beeminder…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you’re not familiar with me, I’m outstandingly lazy. I really
dislike &lt;em&gt;having&lt;/em&gt; to do anything at all. I’m totally fine with
&lt;em&gt;choosing&lt;/em&gt; to do things, but I push back pretty hard against the
universe when something &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to be done. This is why I’m so big
on automation, it reduces the things to have to be done by me,
and allows me to practice &lt;em&gt;efficient laziness&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are some things one simply can’t automate;
flossing your teeth, running a business, doing one’s taxes, getting
some exercise. While I might be able to write digital agents that
can &lt;em&gt;assist&lt;/em&gt; me with those tasks, fundamentally they’re things that
I have to do. The problem is, left to my own devices, I rarely will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is one time when I’ll take action, and that’s when
presented with the threat of imminent failure. If you’ve read
WBW’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html&quot;&gt;excellent article on procrastination&lt;/a&gt;
then you’ll understand that the panic monster is one of the few things
that will get chronic procrastinators to actually move. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For tasks with big, looming deadlines such as &lt;a href=&quot;/talks&quot;&gt;my talks&lt;/a&gt;,
there’s a very clear, and visceral threat of failure. They’re even
worse than most deadlines, because they’re &lt;em&gt;public speaking&lt;/em&gt;, which
is already flat out terrifying, and most of my talks are given in
Australia, where everything is trying to kill you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, if I need to get something done, I’ll promise to present
a talk on it, safe in the knowledge that the fear of public
ridicule and the thought of my audience
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltwater_Crocodile&quot;&gt;taking&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_fish&quot;&gt;me&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_White_Shark&quot;&gt;to&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_jellyfish&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_ringed_octopus&quot;&gt;beach&lt;/a&gt;
will be enough to terrify me into action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet there’s a problem. Small things which I should be doing regularly,
like flossing my teeth, or doing exercise, come with with no
dramatic failure cliffs. And let’s face it, planning to live one’s
life by only doing the most terrifying things at the last possible
moment isn’t exactly the most optimal way to live. This is
where Beeminder comes in handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://beeminder.com&quot; title=&quot;Quantify your goals with Beeminder&quot;&gt;Beeminder&lt;/a&gt; provides the ability to establish
&lt;em&gt;commitment devices&lt;/em&gt;. In the same way that I’ll promise to give
a talk on software I would &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to write, I can use Beeminder
to promise to do something that I would &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to do, but which
I know future me will be unlikely to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beeminder is exceptionally good at taking large or ongoing tasks,
and splitting them into smaller, more achievable goals. It then
draws the most friggin’ nerdtastic graphs ever, with rolling
averages, goal lines, predictive curves, and all sorts of goodies,
so you can see just how well you’re doing. The most important of
these is the ‘yellow brick road’. If you’re on that, then you’re
on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I might achieve my long-term task of good dental hygiene by having
a goal to floss three times each week. Or I might turn my goal of
writing a 5,000 word essay into the task of writing 250 words per day
for 20 days. Beeminder makes it very easy to see if I’m achieving
my goal, or if I’m at risk of falling behind. And if I over-perform
(maybe by writing 1000 words one day), then Beeminder will cut me
some slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the real power of Beeminder is that you can pledge an amount
of money against your goal. Promising that I’m going to floss my
teeth thrice weekly may not be very motivating, but knowing that
I’ll lose $5 if I don’t make my flossing deadline is enough to
have me stumble into the bathroom before bed, rather than promising
to myself that I will do it later. And while I can change my
goals at any time, I have to do it at least a week in advance, so
I can’t weasel out of something just because I don’t want to
do it right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I pay out on the occasional pledge, those amounts
have been absolutely worth it. Overall I’m paying about $0.20/week
for good dental health, and maybe $0.08/day to keep my inbox
under control. A Beeminder pledge has also kept me
attending my last 30 dance lessons, by giving me just enough of
a nudge to not come up with excuses as to why I’m too busy to
go, and I’ve not paid a penny to Beeminder for that goal, as
I’ve never got behind in my dance lessons when I’ve promised to
be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of cool
&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.beeminder.com/akrasia/&quot;&gt;cognitive science behind Beeminder&lt;/a&gt;,
but one of the neat things is they’re
&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; committed to using their own system
to ensure that important tasks like user-visible improvements,
blog-posts, and general support get done. And by very committed, I
mean that the Beeminder team
&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.beeminder.com/blogdog/&quot;&gt;will pay out pledges&lt;/a&gt;
to users that call them out if they fall behind on one of their
goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s what happened last Tuesday. One of the founders
hadn’t spent enough hours on Beeminder that week, and I ended up
$270 richer as a result, and that was one of the smaller
pledges they have on the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, being me, I don’t want to feel I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to check if any
bounties are payable, so I’ve
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pjf/exobrain/blob/master/bin/source/beeminder-bounties&quot;&gt;written some code&lt;/a&gt;
to check for me. I’ve got no qualms about being efficiently lazy when
it comes to motivating others. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
