I've noticed a concerning trend over the last few years, and I'm not
exactly sure what to do about it. As a culture, our communication
habits are changing, and the results may be terrible for our mental
health.

This is a long post, and it's going to help if we start with a brief
reivew of communication over the ages, beginning with face-to-face
interactions. These provide plenty of *non-verbal* signals, such as
body language and vocal tone. It's often clear when interacting with
someone if they're paying attention or distracted; if they're angry,
joking, happy, or just bored. (Although even face-to-face, we're
still good at [getting things wrong][hostility-bias]).

At some point we learnt how to read and write, and while letters were
an important stage in our development, they were not a form of
*real-time* communication, so I'm not going to cover them here.

Skip forward a few thousand years to the telephone. This technology
was game-changing. It allowed people to talk, even when separated by
distance. While it wasn't possible to read body language over the
telephone, one could still read vocal tone. Since telephones were a
fixture in people's homes, you generally knew you had someone's full
attention when you were talking to them, or it became apparent
when you did not.

After the telephone, things get interesting. With the advent of
computers were find ourselves with IRC, chatrooms, SMS, instant
messenger, and a variety of other text-based communication forms.
These provided fewer non-verbal signals (emoticons are
a notable exception here), and provided less clues for when
someone was distracted with other things or not. But still,
one tended to initiate or maintain a conversation with an
individual, or a directed group of people.

But now we're seeing a form of communication which is radically
different from what we've experienced in the past: social media.
The dominant mode of communication with social media is the
*undirected broadcast*, what I call "post-and-hope". You post on your
wall, or tweet to the world, and people may respond, or they may
not. When they do respond, the responses are more emphermeal. It's
harder to have a personal converstaion when all six-hundred of your
friends are watching it, or you're limited to 140 characters.

Social media doesn't preclude more directed conversations,
but it's shifting how we're communicating, and when a friend
being 'online' may simply mean they've opened their phone for a few
seconds in an elevator, there's even more uncertainty associated with
directed conversations than ever before.

{% fancybox pull-right /images/personal/antisocial.jpg "All this technology is making us anti-social" %}

I'm quite aware that "all this technology is making us antisocial"
is hardly a new sentiment. My parents expressed concern about me
hanging out on bulletin boards with 'electronic people' as a teenager,
even though that was exceptionally good for my social and intellectual
development.

<!-- Right pic: IM use is protective of mental health -->

While the scientific literature shows that spending time on instant
messanger is *protective* of mental health if one is feeling socially
isolated¹, studies into social media itself seem to be less clear,
and I'm still trying to make sense of them.

However I've noticed a new and disturbing trend in how *I* socialise.
I communicate with many more people, but I'm much less close to any
of them.

{% pullquote : I communicate with many more people, but I'm less close to any of them. %}

Go back five years ago, and I have a small number of close friends
whom I felt very comfortable talking to, and we would share our
experiences and thoughts extensively. While we weren't in constant
contact, it was very reassuring to know they existed, and I took
for granted that if I was worried, or anxious, or wanted to share
news of a success or receive guidance on some defeat, that I'd have
close friends to fall back on.

Now, things feel different. My close friends are still my friends,
but communicate with them less. When I do communicate,
the conversaions are more shallow. I've noticed that often that's
*my* fault; I'm less likely to have an on-line conversation as a
dedicated activity; often they spin off as side-effects from other
social media use, and they can dry up just as quickly.

<!-- graph right -->

That worries me, not just from a social standpoint, but also
from a mental health one. We know that having a
confidant—someone with whom one feels they can talk to about
anything—is hugely protective to one's mental health.

But this isn't just affecting how I'm interacting with people on-line;
it's also influencing my interactions in meatspace. Because I view
people as less close, I'm less likely to seek them out, and I'm
spending less time with them when I do.

I'm sure part of the reason for these changes is the sheer number
of people with whom I interact with on-line. If you were to go back
a decade ago, I had *dozens* of people in my instant messanger contact
list. Today, my Facebook friends number in the *hundreds*.

I don't yet have enough evidence to say that this is becoming an
issue for society in general, but I'm concerned that it might be.
There's a number of studies showing links between social media
usage and depression, but these don't show causality; people
feeling isolated may be using social media more as a means of
support, and that's certainly something I've done personally in
the past.

Still, it concerns me that personal communication seems to be
becoming less certain and more ephermeal. I'm equally
concerned that that systems like Facebook take the choice of which
stories to display on one's feed out of the user's control, increasing
the possibility of *algorithmic isolation* simply because your
important posts may not be shown to others.
