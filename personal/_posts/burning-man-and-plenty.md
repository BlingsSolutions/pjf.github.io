Burning Man is an odd place, and almost everyone I speak to has a different
idea as to what Burning Man is "about". At the core of Burning Man are the
[ten principles](http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/about_burningman/principles.html)
, but not everyone interprets them the same way, and certainly not everyone
can recite them off the top of their head. When I've asked people what they
were, the most common answer has been: "self-expression, self-reliance,
leave no trace, and... uh... the other seven!"

To me, Burning Man is what I *wish* things would be like when people are
altruistic, care about consequences, and are happy to share of what they have
plenty. The concept of plenty is an important one for me; it's the state
that exists when you have access to so much of something that giving
some away is insignificant. I don't think twice about offering you water
in my home, because my faucet provides me with plenty of water.
Gifting at Burning Man is often founded on an individual or camp having
plenty of something; be that champagne, blinking lights, time, or
stories.

Ideally, when we have plenty of something, we share it with whomever needs it,
regardless of who they are. The "other seven" principles explicitly include
gifting, communal effort, and inclusion, and so I would expect Burning Man
to be an event where people band together to help each other out, regardless
of who they may be.

Unfortunately, too often that's not what I see. While there are some aspects
and planned events in which people appear truly altruistic, much of what
I see at Burning Man are what I see anywhere else in the world: people caring
about themselves and their circle of concern - their friends, their campmates,
and those they want things from in return. This struck me when an attractive
burner asked if I had any sunscreen, and I said I'd go get some, as I always
have plenty of sunscreen. "It's okay," she responded, "I'm a girl, so I'm sure
I'll get some if I just ask a few more people."

The message was clear, that being attractive and female at Burning Man opens
doors which are not otherwise available. In a world where people are encouraged
to share, some people are more readily shared with than others. The flip side
of this turned my stomach even more; there seemed to be no shortage of men
who felt that having a motor home (which includes private showers,
toilets, and an absence of dust) would more easily facilitate them having
sexual relations with women.

Of course, the unequal consideration of gifting didn't just extend to others
based upon gender or attractiveness. Appearance, language ability, reputation,
race, social proof, and a myriad of other factors play a role here. In other words,
all the things that would influence gifting off-playa.

One of my favourite things to do at Burning Man is to help people. There are
some things that can make people utterly miserable; missing a ride, sustaining an
injury, having a vital piece of equipment break. The ethics in these situations
are clear: a little inconvenience to me is well worth the joy I can bring to
another person's life. I'm contemplating learning how to drive and renting
a car in the future, simply because that means I *can* give people lifts in and
out of the burn. I've reduced my purchasing of shared equipment and food, not
because I don't want to share, but because it means I can share these with
anyone without constraint.

It saddens me that observing people at Burning Man reminds me that humans
seem to draw a strong line between those who are close to them (friends,
family, campmates) and those who are not.  I often that people at Burning Man
are so generous and caring, but that doesn't often extend to issues like global
poverty and suffering. My interactions back at home typically have more care
about the suffering of others than my interactions on the playa. This is not a
surprise to me, I surround myself with humanitarians, social activists, and
artists.

There *are* people with generous and caring souls at burning man, and they *do*
make the event great. There are plenty of people who are ignorant of how things
could be, but whom I hope will gain enlightenment in time. But there are also
those who seem wilfully ignorant, and while I can mostly avoid dwelling on them
while I am at home, it's hard not to dwell on them while I'm the desert. These
are not bad people, but they are *indifferent* people, indifference can be
terribly hard to overcome, and is the root of so many injustices in the
modern world.

[Studying ethics](https://www.coursera.org/course/practicalethics) has no doubt
contributed to my thoughts. It's hard to say that Burning Man does much to
contribute to the global good; it *does* show many of the wonderful and
creative things that humans are capable of, but only to those who can afford
the time and resources to attend. By global standards the people at Burning Man
are very white, and very rich.

I intend to keep going back to Burning Man, but I feel it will be
increasingly important for me to have mapped out the humanitarian events and
camps beforehand. I've little doubt that I'll give presentations on
humanitarian issues while there, and one of my goals this year became
meeting people at science and other camps where presentation facilities
were available.

Regardless of whether you're a burner or not, or whether you're in the desert
or not, I would implore you to think about the things which cost you very
little, but which can make a huge difference to others. Please *do not*
restrict yourself to your immediate circle of friends, family, and community.
Think about those who you'll never see again, and *especially* those who
are far away. If you wish to learn more, then
[The Life You Can Save](http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/) has a lot
of resources, thought experiments, and things you can do to help
make the world a better place.
