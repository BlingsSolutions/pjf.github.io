My favourite events are those where people dress up. Halloween, games and anime conventions, burning man, theme parties, and anything that happens in [Harajuku, Japan][]. People being creative and expressing themselves are great, but it’s easy to get caught up in the excitement and forget that fabulously dressed people are *still people*. No matter if you’re admiring, photographing, or the centre of attention, here are a few ways to make your life—and the life of those around you—more excellent.

While this article provides some guidelines to social interaction, please be mindful of what others are doing before you interact with them. Someone who’s eating, taking a break, engaged in conversation, or looks worn-out may not appreciate the interruption; whereas a person who’s beaming a smile at you is likely to be delighted if you have a chat with them.

## You look incredible!

You can and *should* tell people how good they look, especially if they’ve dressed up for an event you’re attending! If you want to tell someone they look great, but are not sure how, the following are almost always well received:

- You look amazing!
- How did you make [awesome feature]?
- You’re dressed as [character] from [pop culture reference]. You look *so cool*!
- You must have spent forever making that! I am in awe!
- I love your [hair/make-up/accessories/crown/props]!

Complimenting others is especially important if you’re at an event where *everyone* is dressed up. It’s surprisingly easy to feel self-conscious when other folks are around with amazing outfits, and a compliment from a stranger can really make one’s day.

Sometimes you won’t be able to say something directly, but you can let people know they look great from a distance with non-verbal language. I’m fond of huge smile and a double [a-ok sign][], although a thumbs-up, salute, bow, or even a nod of the head can act as an acknowledgement of awesome.

It’s *never* appropriate to make sexualised comments about people you don’t know; it’s creepy. Even if they’re dressed as a magic card, save the “I’d tap that” comments for close friends or people you’re actually sleeping with. You want people to feel good about themselves, not worry that the conversation is going to take an inappropriate turn. This applies even to “sexy” outfits where you don’t know the person.

Just one final note: if you’re in a situation where the other person can’t easily leave—like in a train or elevator—then spare your compliments, or at least save them until *you* are leaving the scene. Conversations can be very uncomfortable to someone who doesn’t even have the option of leaving, and you want people to feel safe and appreciated, not threatened.

## Look, don’t touch

Please don’t touch people or their possessions without asking them first. Touching strangers without permission is creepy, and just because they’re dressed up doesn’t make it any less so.

You should ask for permission to touch even if you know the person well. A lot of amazing outfits are fragile: props can break, make-up can smudge, jingly-jangles can get caught, and costumes may be a lot more precariously held together than they look.

Even if you have a friend you know is okay with you touching them, be mindful about making sure they can see you first. Being in costume can attract unwanted attention, and being touched by someone you can’t see can be *very* uncomfortable, especially if it’s a large event with lots of strangers present.

## Receiving Compliments

If you’re dressed up, then you can expect to receive some compliments! You look *great*, and you should feel great because of it! If you’re not sure how to respond, a positive thank you is always appropriate:

- Thank you so much!
- Thanks! I put in a lot of effort and I’m glad it paid off!
- Thank you! I really appreciate hearing that!

While it’s tempting to be self-deprecating as a form of modesty  (“oh, my outfit isn’t *that* good”), it comes with the risk of believing it yourself. You do look incredible, and you *should* feel great about that! More subtly, the person paying you compliments may have aspirations to be as good as you, and you don’t want to lessen their dreams by saying what you’ve done doesn’t count.

If you really want to make someone’s day, pay them a counter-compliment, or ask if you can get a photograph with them. A lot of people who compliment you are too polite to ask for photos, and will often be really excited by the offer to have one taken with them.

## Photographs

Consent to be photographed is just like any other sort of consent: it’s active, enthusiastic, and ongoing. Just because someone isn’t actively objecting to you photographing them doesn’t mean they’re happy about it.

You should ask nicely before taking someone’s photo, and understand they might say no. If they’re eating, taking time out, or obviously engaged in something else, then please wait for a better opportunity. Having an eye-catching outfit can come with a *lot* of attention, and moments to relax and be oneself (including introvert time) can be vital. If someone is posing for photographs for someone else, ask if you can snap a picture as well.

You should also ask before using a flash. Direct flash is unpleasant for anyone, but even off-axis flash can be damaging for someone with epilepsy, light sensitivity, or a headache. “Is it okay if I use a flash?” shows a lot of respect for who you’re photographing, and can really help put them at ease.

If you’re an experienced photographer you probably know what angles are going to make for the best pictures, but ask “are you okay if we do a few different poses?” if you’re going to need more than a few moments of your subject’s time. If you’re asking your subject to do *anything* it should be done in an affirmative and body-positive way. Try “you’d look amazing if you turned slightly and looked back towards me”, or “can I get you to take a deep breath and look powerful?” to get the most flattering angles. Don’t imply that your subject’s body is anything less than perfect; it’s their body, and being behind a lens doesn’t give you license to pass judgement.

## Staying in touch

Staying in touch with the amazing people you meet is great, but it’s *only* cool if they want that too. Rather than asking for private details—which not everyone will be comfortable sharing—instead ask if you can follow them on a public-facing social media service like Twitter or Tumblr. Better still, you can ask my favourite question:

> Do you have a Facebook fan page?

This question does everything right when talking to strangers: you’re suggesting they’re amazing enough to have a dedicated fan page, they can *choose* to share their personal details if they want, and it’s not weird if they say no.

If you’ve taken photographs, it’s polite to ask your subject if they’d like a copy of them, along with “what’s the best way to get them to you?”. They might decline, but the important thing is to give *them* the choice of what contact information they wish to share, if any.

## Use your best judgement

Humans don’t run by hard-and-fast rules, and what’s appropriate will depend upon your situation and the people you are interacting with. But no matter whether you’re in costume, photographing, admiring, or any other human interaction, you’ll find that clear and honest communication, along with ensuring you have active and enthusiastic consent, will go a long way in making your life and lives of those around you even more fabulous than it already is!
