Hi everyone! I give talks, write articles, and frequently share my thoughts and opinions. Here I've tried to summarise my "best of" output for 2015.

### Writing

I do a lot of writing about technology, mental health, society, and the future. Here are some selected pieces from this year:

* [Why non-code contributions matter](http://pjf.id.au/tech/2015/02/15/why-non-code-contributions-matter.html)
* [Human relevance in the age of machines](http://pjf.id.au/tech/2015/08/04/how-will-humans-remain-relevant.html)
* [Buzzconf was awesome](http://pjf.id.au/tech/2015/11/16/buzzconf-was-awesome.html)
* [Duck yes! SpaceX lands Falcon 9](http://pjf.id.au/tech/2015/12/22/spacex-lands-rocket-duck-yes.html)
* [Just love each other](http://pjf.id.au/personal/2015/12/25/just-love-each-other.html)
* [It's time we spoke about loneliness](http://pjf.id.au/depression/2015/09/06/its-time-we-spoke-about-loneliness.html)
* [I'm donating 10% of my income to causes that do the most good](http://pjf.id.au/ethics/2015/08/20/im-donating-10pc-of-my-income-to-charity.html)

### Videos

While I've appeared at a number of conferences in 2015, not all of my talks have been taped. However I'm *very* pleased with the ones that have:

* [Open Source and Social Change, Making the World a Better Place](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuK6udkbyGo) (20 minutes OSCON keynote)
* [The Future is Awesome (machine ethics and emerging technologies)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7TwbTtofLo) (10 minute OSCON keynote)
* [The Future is Awesome (machine ethics and emerging technologies)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7TwbTtofLo) (40 minute in-depth [PLUG][] talk)

### Audio

I keep wanting to record more audio, but it's something I need to have sufficient time for and be in the right mood:

* [The Night Watch, by James Mickens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7mMvPmF-Vw)

### Facebook long-posts

I've also written a number of longer Facebook posts that haven't made
it to the rest of the internet yet:

* [The humanity of kicking a robot](https://www.facebook.com/paul.fenwick/posts/10152755099264611)
* [Seven tips for starting a healthy community](https://www.facebook.com/paul.fenwick/posts/10153256633354611)
* [Technological unemployment](https://www.facebook.com/paul.fenwick/posts/10153293671144611)
* [Code is like sausages](https://www.facebook.com/paul.fenwick/posts/10153376018579611)
* [Numbers in Japanese](https://www.facebook.com/paul.fenwick/posts/10153398786134611)
