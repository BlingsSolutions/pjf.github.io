Dating by its very nature is *intentionally* confusing, because it's all about saving face.

Directly saying "hey, I think you're great, do you want to date?" is scary because the other person might say no, and the more you like them, the more scary that is.

So instead we do everything indirectly: "would you like some pie?", "would you like to go out for dinner?", "would you like to join my crew on puzzle pirates?".

The indirect approach is face-saving if it doesn't work out, because *friends* also have dinner and talk like pirates. We can tell ourselves that the reason nothing has happened is because they didn't realise we were flirting, not because they declined our advances.

However, there are so many ways this can go wrong. A person who doesn't get the message that the object of their affection isn't interested can become very bothersome, as they can keep "being nice" and expecting something in return. The flip side is that they may feel the person isn't interested when they *are* and give up, providing very confusing signals. The person who's being flirted with who doesn't realise what's happening may either miss out on an opportunity they'd like, or may not be able to communicate that they're not interested.

Except the ways we communicate that we're not interested are all pretty awful. Again, because flirting is all about being indirect, they tend to be phrases like "I already have a partner", or "I don't feel like I'm ready for a relationship", both of which are disingenuous when the real meaning is "sorry, I think you're an awesome person, but I'm not interested in a sexual/romantic relationship with you".

All of these are things that get instilled in us by society, and it's even worse because we still have gender roles which say it should be the *man* making the moves. In heterosexual relationships this not only disempowers women from taking an active role in their romantic decisions, but means that heterosexual men not only feel *obliged* to initiate flirting, but they can easily end up with no life experience whatsoever as to what it's like to be the object of unwanted attention. In homosexual relationships the result is that gay relations often move more quickly (as both actors are empowered by their gender norms) and lesbian relations move much more slowly (as both actors are disempowered by gender norms).

It no surprise that cultures create all sorts of elaborate-yet-indirect forms to signal interest. I'm pretty sure that I saw a Star Trek episode where Kirk unexpectedly became engaged because he ate a slice of pie (or something), which culturally signified that he wished to wed.

TL;DR: Dating is confusing by design.
