I'm a man.

I've never been sexually assaulted. I've never even had to *worry* about sexual
assault. When I walk home at night, I'm not concerned that what I'm wearing
might attract unwanted attention. When I meet a stranger I've been speaking to
on a dating website, the most I fear is that our conversation might be dull.
When I'm couchsurfing, I don't question what my hosts are going to be like and
whether I'll be safe. When I'm at a conference in my field, I've never had
someone ask me if I'm there "with my partner". When I sleep with lots of
people, nobody ever calls me a whore. If I were to have children, nobody would
question me continuing my career rather than looking after them full time.

And I haven't even gotten started yet.

Saying that men are privileged isn't an insult. It's not saying men are bad
people. It's just saying how things are.

Privilege isn't some binary quality; the fact that women may be privileged when
it comes to working with children doesn't somehow stop men from being
privileged elsewhere. There are different types of privilege; yours doesn't get
cancelled out just because someone else has a different type.

Acknowledging privilege is acknowledging that some things are unfair, it's
acknowledging the truth. But more importantly, it's acknowledging that things
*don't have to be that way*. Acknowledging that you have privilege isn't 
admitting that you're wrong, it isn't saying you're a bad person... it's the 
very first step in making things better, and that is very, very right.
