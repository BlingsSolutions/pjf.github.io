Some of you know I run the Australian National Rick Astley Hotline, on +61-3-8652-1453 . Today, in celebration of troublemakers everywhere, I've upgraded it.

<!--more-->

Calling the number will *still* give you the classic Rick you've always loved, but *now* you can use your keypad for extra joy. I'll let you discover all the options, and how it works.

In celebration of the upgrade, I've *also* provisioned the United States National Rick Astley Hotline, on +1-760-706-RICK (+1-760-706-7425).

If you wish to help defray my costs, you can do so [via Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/_pjf), but mostly I want you to share the numbers with your friends. :)

You're welcome, internet, you're welcome. :)
