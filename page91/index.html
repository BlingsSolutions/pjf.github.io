            <B>Business</b><BR>
Working as a consultant for an old employer.  Lots of happy people there who are glad to have me around.  However, this means that I'm out of the office for 70% of business hours, which doesn't leave me with much time to run <i>my</i> business and attend to my less demanding customers.
<P>
Jacinta should be starting her first week of proper part-time work with <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a> this week, so hopefully she'll be able to keep things in check until they quieten down (about a month's time).
<p>
<b>Health</b><br>
Jacinta's all healed, out of the neckbrace, and fit enough to go diving.  This is a very good thing.
<p>
<b>Diving</b><br>
Some very generous friends of ours gave us a free "dive experience" voucher which they had won, since they already had dive licenses and didn't need supervisors to hold their hands underwater.  The "experience" was a lot of theory, hand-signals, and exercises, and less actual diving than I would have preferred.
<p>
Met up with an old friend from high-school on the day, who was helping out as an employee of the dive shop.  Apparently it's a fun way to earn extra money to do diving, although I suspect that he's still working as a laywer when not in a wetsuit.
<p>
<b>Tax</b><br>
Q3 BAS done.  I'm glad they only come around four times a year.
<p>
<b>Chickens</b><br>
The chooks are all more-or-less broken.  One's broody, one's laying soft-shelled eggs, one seems to have an egg-eating problem, and the others aren't laying as much as they used to.  It may be time to get new chickens.
<p>
<b>Rabbit</b><br>
Doesn't lay eggs, but hasn't destroyed any electrical equipment recently.  Good rabbit.
<p>
<b>Rain</b><br>
We actually got a decent amount of rain in the last few days.  Enough to fill most of the water tank, and turn our backyard from brown to green.  I'd still like more rain, some of our trees are still rather stressed.
<p>
<b>Phone</b><br>
Have a new mobile phone.  It's free (Jacinta's mother works for a telco), but obviously aimed at teenagers.  It comes with colour screen, polyphonic speaker, and skateboarder animations.  All the ring-tones sound like a slots machine going off.  It's notably missing an infra-red port, so it doesn't talk to the palm pilot at all.
<p>
The nice thing about the phone is that it has a vibrate function.  That's a good thing, considering how embarrassing the ringtones are.

If you're reading this from Australia, then you better make sure that you don't use your VCR to tape shows from television.  Most people don't realise that <a href="http://www.copyright.org.au/PDF/InfoSheets/G025.pdf">doing so is illegal in Australia</a>.
<p>
In other news, I've managed to use my Palm Pilot to transfer music from my computer to my/Ian's mobile phone, and I have far too big a backlog of work and invoices to catch up upon.

            <B>Rain</b><BR>
None. Nil.  Nada.  Zero.  Zilch.  Victoria is in heavy drought right now.  Water restrictions are in place, and there's no indication they'll stop anytime soon.  We have a 1000 litre rainwater tank for gardening and livestock, so keeping our trees alive doesn't place any additional burdens on our resevoirs.  Unfortunately, the tank is becoming rather empty, and the days are <i>very</i> hot and dry.  I'm really hoping we get some rain soon, but the <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/">BOM</a> doesn't thik that's likely in the next week.
<p>
<b>Cereal Toys</b><br>
Once upon a time, when you opened your box of corn flakes, you might get a little plastic truck or aircraft.  Yesterday I got a <i>Age of Empires</i> complete game on CD in the cereal box.  There was a huge shelf of them.  Looks like the cereal manufacturer thinks they can sell more boxes if they put games in them, and the whole box and game intro pushes hard about how good the game expansion is, and why you should buy it.
<p>
Mind you, I'll admit the game's been more fun than a plastic truck.
<p>
<b>Toys</b><br>
Lots of toys arrived today.  I now have much more desk space, and a <i>huge</i> bed with a 15 year warranty.

            <B>Phone</b><BR>
My old phone had an unfortunate accident and its antenna snapped off.  It doesn't work very well without its antenna, so I'm looking for a new phone.  Usually, when I'm in need of new hardware, I turn to Ian's House of Secondhand Electronics.  Ian is almost always up-to-date with the latest gadgets, and hence often has older technology that he's no longer using.  Since Ian had recently showed me his new super-phone, I figured there'd be a good chance he had another, unused phone lying around somewhere.  Sure enough, he did.
<p>
My old phone has the size and functionality approaching that of a small housebrick.  It can store numbers on the SIM card, dial them, turn itself off without no good reason, and snap its antenna off should you sit upon it.  I was hoping for a new phone that had about the same set of features or better, so Ian's "old" phone was a bit of a surprise.
<p>
The phone has a Java Virtual Machine, mp3 player, WAP, an assortment of games, voice dialing, dictaphone, infra-red port, and a variety of other things that I'm sure are completely unnecessary on a mobile phone.  It uses multi-media memory cards (MMCs), exactly the same things that my Palm uses.  In fact, it talks to the Palm rather well.  I've almost reached the stage where I can get my Palm to dial out through the phone, and establish an ssh connection with a remote machine.
<p>
I've only found two problems with the phone.  It doesn't appreciate my Palm trying to send its entire vcard database at once (it only accepts the first entry), and one of the most useful buttons is broken.  The broken button can be ignored 90% of the time, and is a complete and utter pain in the rear for the remaining 10%.  On the other hand, Ian is selling the phone at a very reasonable price, so I'll have to see what I think over the coming week.
<p>
<B>Work</b><BR>
I <i>so</i> want to be back on holidays.
<p>
<B>Frontier: First Enounters</b><BR>
Wow, it really does work under Linux.  In fact, it works really really well under Linux.  I'm very impressed.
<p>
<B>Chickens</b><BR>
One of our chickens is still broken.  For reasons unknown, she's laying eggs with <i>very</i> thin shells.  This is very bad, since they break in the nest and foul it.  This messes up the other eggs, bedding materials, and any chickens that are inclined to go broody.  The chooks have plenty of grit and calcium sources available.
<p>
Unfortunately, I have no idea which chicken is having difficulties.  Separating a few of the hens around laying time should reveal the culprit.
