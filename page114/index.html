            <B>House</b><BR>
We made an offer on the house, and someone else made an
offer for the full asking price, so they got it.  I'm not
too upset, as there are plenty of other nicer houses out
there, and in a few months time I'll be in a much better
position to buy.  What I find interesting is that both Ian
and Sofie, and Benni and Tara are looking at buying houses
now.  It's almost looking like a Monopoly game.
<P>
<B>Banks</b><BR>
One of the banks who I was talking about home-loans with
wants to give me a complimentary credit card with an
outrageously large credit limit.  I'll be handing it back to
them.
<P>
<B>Diplomacy</b><BR>
Junwei is winning, and after this game I am going to have to
take lessons from him about how he does this.  Italy (Phil)
is eating out of Junwei's hand, and is probably going to
spur Junwei on to victory.  I think we're going to have a
hard time convincing Phil that possibly losing is better
than helping Junwei and definitely losing.  Unfortunately
being the second largest power, everything thinks I'm trying
to nobble Junwei so that I can win.  The truth is I want to
nobble Junwei so that I don't lose.  I'm much rather force
Junwei to draw than have him win the game.  I'm researching
stalemate lines to see what I can do.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Negotiating with Dan to try and get a nine day fortnight. 
Believe it or not, I actually want more of a life.  There's
been a lot of proceedural stuff flying around recently, and
not all of it is stable yet.  It should be good once it is, 
because as bug-boy I want quality more than most.
<P>
A legacy version of one of our products is now finally
finished, the customers using it having upgraded to the
latest and greatest.  This makes me very happy.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Spent some time at CERES (a beautiful environmental park)
and hacked together a lot more of the documentation.  The
project is almost ready for release, but I need to find some
spare time where <A HREF=http://www.adom.de/>ADOM</a>
doesn't tempt me too much so I can finish it.  I should also
get in contact with Jon again about The Perl Journal
article.
<P>
<B>Ian</b><BR>
Ian has his new car, and he's so proud.  I want him to act
as taxi-boy this weekend for rockclimbing.
<P>
<B>Rockclimbing</b><BR>
Finally climbed Cretin, and (after Ian and Ben's most
helpful advice) discovered that it was much easier than
expected.
<P>
<B>Hacky-sack</b><BR>
We have a <I>lot</i> of skill in Schoolsnet now.  I'm very
proud of everyone.  To quote Natedawg, <I>"We have the
reflexes of a momma!"</i>

            <B>House</b><BR>
Made an offer on the house today, and there seems to be a
very good possibility that we'll be accepted as well.  We
should know in the next couple of days what's happening.  If
everything goes well we'll be moving in about three months
time.
<P>
<B>Permaculture</b><BR>
The local trainstation had a big impressive permaculture
poster up which appears to have been sponsored by the train
company.  Surprisingly enough it wasn't just "trains are
good" propaganda, but made mention of low-impact housing,
backyard food systems, and (surprisingly enough) <A
HREF="http://www.vmore.org.au/~damon/cm/">Critical
Mass.</a>.  It's good to see things like this going up
around the city -- sometimes it seems that any poster
advocating sustainability lives inside a University campus,
or leads a very brief existence before it's plastered over
with concert posters.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Friday drinks are finally becoming a little more organised
and are running more smoothly.  There was a small problem
where we miscalculated the horde of brew we were purchasing,
and a couple of the pizzas we ordered didn't come through. 
Depsite this everything seems to have gone well, and we have
what I hope to be a sustainable system in place.
<P>
I'm expecting to see a few sparks on Monday regarding some
mis-communication problems, and I think that we really need
a good priority system implemented for tasks, as not
everyone sees eye-to-eye about which tasks are the most
important.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
It works.  It's beautiful.  It's extensible.  It should be
released.  However, I haven't finished the API
documentation.  I should also check with Jon about when I'm
supposed to have my article for TPJ written -- there's
nothing like writing an article to speed up the next release
of a project.
<P>
<B>Melbourne Geeks</b><BR>
Rita, who used to work for Schoolsnet, is now working for
Allison, who I was trying to poach to Schoolsnet when Rita
first joined.  Allison also did software
engineering/computer science with Jacinta (who used to work
at Schoolsnet) and Elise (who now has my old job at ITS). 
Sometimes I get a feeling that I'm only one link away from
every other geek in Melbourne.

            <B>Hacky Injury</b><BR>
An important lesson for all those people planning to play
hackey-sack in an office environment.  If you're playing
without shoes, and the hackey comes down just on the corner
of a table, pull your kick.  Table-corners hurt a lot when
you kick them with the upper bits of your feet.
<P>
<B>Rockclimbing</b><BR>
Had a great time rockclimbing.  Kathryn came with us this
week, and showed an excellent amount of skill for a
first-time climber.  I climbed the black that I'd been
working on for a couple of weeks, and decided that it's
either been made a lot easier, or I've become a much better
climber.  At the end of the day we had races up the red
climb on the training wall, and I lost.  I blame it on my
colour-blindness, having to always look twice before going
for a hold.
<P>
<B>Houses</b><BR>
After visiting the real-estate agent we decided to put our
offer in on Saturday when we'd be eligible for the $7000
government bonus for first home-buyers.

my %info = $quoter-&gt;fetch("nasdaq","LNUX");<BR>
</tt>
</blockquote>
<P>
<TT>%info</tt> will now contain information about <I>VA
Linux Systems</i>, except all information will be in
Australian dollars, rather than the US dollars which
<I>Yahoo</i>
supplies it in.  This makes me very happy indeed, and means
that it's now very very very easy to write stock tickers and
the like which show information in your local currency.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
We have very sweet people at work, especially Tim from the
Support team.  Tim hasn't thrown any bugs my way in weeks,
for which I'm very grateful.
