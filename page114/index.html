            <B>House</b><BR>
Made an offer on the house today, and there seems to be a
very good possibility that we'll be accepted as well.  We
should know in the next couple of days what's happening.  If
everything goes well we'll be moving in about three months
time.
<P>
<B>Permaculture</b><BR>
The local trainstation had a big impressive permaculture
poster up which appears to have been sponsored by the train
company.  Surprisingly enough it wasn't just "trains are
good" propaganda, but made mention of low-impact housing,
backyard food systems, and (surprisingly enough) <A
HREF="http://www.vmore.org.au/~damon/cm/">Critical
Mass.</a>.  It's good to see things like this going up
around the city -- sometimes it seems that any poster
advocating sustainability lives inside a University campus,
or leads a very brief existence before it's plastered over
with concert posters.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Friday drinks are finally becoming a little more organised
and are running more smoothly.  There was a small problem
where we miscalculated the horde of brew we were purchasing,
and a couple of the pizzas we ordered didn't come through. 
Depsite this everything seems to have gone well, and we have
what I hope to be a sustainable system in place.
<P>
I'm expecting to see a few sparks on Monday regarding some
mis-communication problems, and I think that we really need
a good priority system implemented for tasks, as not
everyone sees eye-to-eye about which tasks are the most
important.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
It works.  It's beautiful.  It's extensible.  It should be
released.  However, I haven't finished the API
documentation.  I should also check with Jon about when I'm
supposed to have my article for TPJ written -- there's
nothing like writing an article to speed up the next release
of a project.
<P>
<B>Melbourne Geeks</b><BR>
Rita, who used to work for Schoolsnet, is now working for
Allison, who I was trying to poach to Schoolsnet when Rita
first joined.  Allison also did software
engineering/computer science with Jacinta (who used to work
at Schoolsnet) and Elise (who now has my old job at ITS). 
Sometimes I get a feeling that I'm only one link away from
every other geek in Melbourne.

            <B>Hacky Injury</b><BR>
An important lesson for all those people planning to play
hackey-sack in an office environment.  If you're playing
without shoes, and the hackey comes down just on the corner
of a table, pull your kick.  Table-corners hurt a lot when
you kick them with the upper bits of your feet.
<P>
<B>Rockclimbing</b><BR>
Had a great time rockclimbing.  Kathryn came with us this
week, and showed an excellent amount of skill for a
first-time climber.  I climbed the black that I'd been
working on for a couple of weeks, and decided that it's
either been made a lot easier, or I've become a much better
climber.  At the end of the day we had races up the red
climb on the training wall, and I lost.  I blame it on my
colour-blindness, having to always look twice before going
for a hold.
<P>
<B>Houses</b><BR>
After visiting the real-estate agent we decided to put our
offer in on Saturday when we'd be eligible for the $7000
government bonus for first home-buyers.

use Finance::Quote;<BR>
my $quoter = Finance::Quote-&gt;new;<BR>
$quoter-&gt;set_currency("AUD");<BR>
my %info = $quoter-&gt;fetch("nasdaq","LNUX");<BR>
</tt>
</blockquote>
<P>
<TT>%info</tt> will now contain information about <I>VA
Linux Systems</i>, except all information will be in
Australian dollars, rather than the US dollars which
<I>Yahoo</i>
supplies it in.  This makes me very happy indeed, and means
that it's now very very very easy to write stock tickers and
the like which show information in your local currency.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
We have very sweet people at work, especially Tim from the
Support team.  Tim hasn't thrown any bugs my way in weeks,
for which I'm very grateful.

Had a good night of hacking, and fixed a number of items I
had outstanding on my list of jobs.
<P>
One thing that had me stumped for a while was with the
Yahoo::Europe module.  Xose had provided me with a working
set of code which rolls all the hard parts of Yahoo lookups
into a common base, and even squeezes out a bunch of
complexity to boot.  However, the code Xose provided me
with, and the code that Yahoo::Europe used, didn't make use 
of all the data available from Yahoo.  I was pretty certain
there wasn't much difference between the European Yahoo
stock scripts and those from Yahoo USA, so I figured that it
should be easy to have them both fetch the same data.
<P>
Unfortunately, while the idea was simple in theory, it
proved to be a bit more of a challenge in practice.  The
data I got back on the European stocks had field mismatches
and data corruption.  Very odd, especially considering I was
getting the same information fine through the webpage.
<P>
I eventually found the problem.  F::Q was fetching the
information from Yahoo's French site, and the French
apparently use commas rather than periods as their decimal
point.  This is fine, except when exporting decimal
information into a comma-delimited file.  Fetching the
information from Yahoo UK fixed the problem immediately.
<P>
<B>Diplomacy</b><BR>
The third game has started, and I've been watching some of
the politics going on as the impartial arbitrator.  I'm
having a ball watching how everyone's trying to make things
work for them.
<P>
The game I'm playing in has just got very interesting. 
Junwei got stabbed by Phil, so the next year or so should be
very interesting.  I have to admit, Phil has guts.  He
wasn't happy just to stab the largest power in the game, he
also sent out an attack force against the second largest
power as well.  It will be interesting to see how this all
turns out.
