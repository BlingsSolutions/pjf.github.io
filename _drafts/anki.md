What if I told you there's an app which runs on all your devicesq, is
free, has strong evidence-based support for its effectiveness, and
allows you to acquire large amounts of knowledge and
*retain it indefinitely*?



Recently I posted a rant to Facebook encouraging people to do things
*other* than look at social media while they're bored. A few people had
responses like this:

> What else can I do in 10-minute chunks while I wait for coffee to become

Those odd chunks of time, while making coffee, waiting for the train,
standing in yet another queue at the airport. That's when I get most
of my learning done.

There are two amazing tools which I use during those odd chunks of time.
The first [reads me articles I've saved][], and requires only that I
have headphones. But the second, and more exciting, is [anki][anki];
it's like having cheat-codes for knowledge.

Anki is a flash-card system that employs [spaced reptition][],
which exploits our understanding of human memory to allow you to
obtain a large amount of knowledge, and then
*retain that knowledge indefinitely*. 

We know from research that we remember things most *efficiently* when
we're tested infrequently over a longer time span.  If you've ever
crammed for an exam, you'll know that often you've forgotten much of
that knowledge a week or two later. Anki and spaced repitition
gives us *anti-cramming*, letting you do a minimum of work to memorise
information over a long period of times.

The working behind spaced reptition is simple. Every time you
successfully remember a piece of knowledge, there's a longer delay
until you're tested on it again.  The idea is to get you to recall
knowledge just before you're about to forget it.
