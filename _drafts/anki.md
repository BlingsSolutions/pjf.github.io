What if I told you there's a system, which is free, has strong
evidence-based support for its effectiveness, and allows you to
acquire large amounts of knowledge and *retain it indefinitely*?

What if I told you that 

Recently I posted a rant to Facebook encouraging people to do things
*other* than look at social media while they're bored. A few people had
responses like this:

> What else can I do in 10-minute chunks while I wait for coffee to become
> coffee?

Those odd chunks of time, while making coffee, waiting for the train,
standing in yet another queue at the airport. That's when I get most
of my learning done.

There are two amazing tools which I use during those odd chunks of time.
The first [reads me articles I've saved][], and requires only that I
have headphones. The second is anki; it's like having cheat-codes for
knowledge.

Anki is a flash-card system that employs [spaced reptition][], which
exploits how our memory operates. We remember things most *efficiently*
when we're tested infrequently over a longer time span. If you've
ever crammed for an exam, you'll know that often you've forgotten much
of that knowledge a week or two later. Anki gives us *anti-cramming*.

Spaced repetition is tailored to allow you to obtain a large amount
of knowledge, and then *retain that knowledge indefinitely*.
