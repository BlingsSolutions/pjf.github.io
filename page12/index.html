            <p><b>Dark Stalking on Facebook</b><br>
For a while I've been using Facebook's API and <a href="http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/FQL">Facebook Query Language</a> (FQL) via Perl's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?WWW::Facebook::API">WWW::Facebook::API</a> module to run fairly innocent queries on my friends.  If I visit a town, I'd like a reminder of who lives there.  If I want to go rock-climbing, it helps if I can easily search to see which of my friends share that hobby.  This is good, innocent stuff, and makes me glad to be a developer.
<p>
Last week I decided to play with event searches.  If a large number of my friends are attending an event, there's a good chance I'll find it interesting, and I'd like to know about it.  FQL makes this sort of thing really easy; in fact, finding all your friends' events is on their <a href="http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Sample_FQL_Queries">Sample FQL Queries</a> page.
<p>
Using the example provided by Facebook, I dropped the query into my sandbox, and looked at the results which came back.  The results were disturbing.  I didn't just get back future events my friends were attending.  I got <i>everything</i> they had been invited to: past and present, attending or not.
<p>
I didn't sleep well that night.  I didn't expect Facebook to share past event info.  I didn't expect it to share info when people had <i>declined</i> those events.  I haven't found any way of retrieving friends' past events using Facebook's website, but using FQL made it easy.  Somehow, implicitly, I thought old events would fade away, only viewable to those who already knew about them.  I didn't expect them to stick around for my code to harvest, potentially years into the future.
<p>
Finding my friends' old events crossed a moral boundary I honestly didn't expect to encounter.  Without intending, I really felt like I was snooping.  It didn't matter that these friends had agreed to share this information under the Facebook <a href="http://www.facebook.com/terms.php">terms and conditions</a>.  <i>I</i> would personally feel uncomfortable with this much information being so readily available, and assume my friends would feel the same.
<p>
However my accidental crossing of moral boundaries wasn't the only thing that kept me awake last night.  I was also kept awake by wondering just <i>how much</i> information could I tease out of the Facebook API.  What could I discover?  What if I were evil?
<p>
However I'm <i>not</i> evil, so I put my code on hold for a while and made a call for volunteers.  I'd be restricting myself to just using the Facebook API, and without them installing any additional applications.  I wouldn't share their data in any way, but I'd be able to inspect and use it, and would try to provide them with a copy when I was done.  To be honest, I was surprised by the response; I now have almost two dozen people who have agreed to participate, covering a wide range of lifestyles and privacy settings.
<p>
The results have been very interesting.  I expected to be able to obtain personal information, including things like events, photographs, and friends; it doesn't take much imagination with the <a href="http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Category:FQL_Tables">FQL tables</a> to find those.  What was most interesting are some of the more creative queries I was able to run.
<p>
Most recently, I've been able to obtain status feeds, even for users who have <i>very</i> tight privacy settings, although I had to tweak my own application's privileges to do so.  I don't know how far into the past these go, but they also come with <i>likes</i> information, and <i>comments</i>.  This gives me a wealth of information on the strength and types of relationships people have.  A person who comments a lot on another user's posts probably finds that user interesting.  If I descended into keyword and text analysis, I may even be able to determine <i>how</i> they find that user interesting.
<p>
But by far the most interesting part of all of this have been <i>dark users</i>.  Like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter">dark matter</a>, these users are not directly observable, usually because they've completely disabled API access.  In fact, some of these users are <i>completely</i> dark unless you're a friend.  They don't show up in search results.  They don't show up on friends' lists.  You can't send them messages.  If you try to navigate to their user page (assuming you know it exists), you get redirected back to your homepage.  These users have their privacy settings turned up real high, and are <i>supposed</i> to be hard to find.
<p>
However like dark matter, dark users <i>are</i> observable due to their effects on the rest of the universe.  If a dark user comments on a stream entry, I can see that comment.  More importantly, I can <i>see their user-ID</i>, and I can generate a URL to a page that will contain their name.  I can then watch for their activities elsewhere.  Granted, I can't <i>directly</i> search for their activity, but I can observe their effects on my friends.  For want of a better term, I've been calling this "dark stalking".
<p>
What makes this all rather chilling is that I'm doing all of this via the application API.  If your <i>friend</i> has installed an application, then it can access quite a lot of information about you, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=platform&tab=other">unless you turn it off</a>.  If your <i>friend</i> has granted the application the <tt>read_stream</tt> privilege, then it can read <i>your</i> status stream.  Even if a <i>friend of a friend</i> has done this, and you comment on your friend's status entries, it's possible to infer your existence and retrieve those discussions through dark stalking.
<p>
While I've always considered people's own carelessness to be the biggest threats to their own privacy, in the social 2.0 world it seems we need to be increasingly worried about our friends, too!
<p>
I'm preparing a detailed paper with the results of my research (which is still ongoing), but I will be presenting my preliminary findings at <a href="http://barcampmelbourne.org/">BarCampMelbourne</a>, this weekend (11-12th September 2009), with a further update at the <a href="http://www.tucs.org.au/">University of Tasmania Computing Society (TUCS)</a> on the 2nd October.  A conference talk will invariably follow.
<p>
If you want to keep track of my research, then you can <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=145076327240">join the facebook group</a>, or the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/facebook-privacy">facebook privacy group</a>.  I prefer comments and questions to directly to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/facebook-privacy">facebook privacy group</a>, or <a href="mailto:pjf@perltraining.com.au">to me directly</a>.

            <p><b>BarCampMelbourne and Social 2.0</b><br>
In a week's time I'll be attending <a href="http://barcampmelbourne.org/">BarCampMelbourne</a>.  Registrations close on September 7th, so if you want to attend, now's the time to register.
<p>
Now, BarCamps are pretty cool, but I'm particularly excited about this one because I'm going to be doing a talk on something I've been playing with for a while, which is having an Augmented Social Life, or just Social 2.0.
<p>
In the last few years, social networks have flourished, and an unprecedented amount of private data is available on-line.  I'll be demonstrating how to use modern social networks to improve your social life.  That includes techniques on turning Facebook into beer.
<p>
However what I find most fascinating is from a privacy standpoint.  Whenever I find a social network, I go looking for an API, and some APIs are more revealing than others.  In particular, Facebook provides Facebook Query Language (FQL), which allows for some incredibly powerful queries.  What makes it particularly scary is that with the default privacy settings, one can mine a huge amount of private information by having a <i>friend</i> who has installed an ethically bankrupt application.
<p>
I'll be giving some rather real-world examples of using and abusing facebook.  Some are good, like reminding you which friends are in a city you're visiting, or which friends share a particular hobby.  However many are more scary.  I can demonstrate how to find people you've met at events, based purely on their first name.  How to look into other people's past, and see what they were doing years ago.  How to find out what applications your friends have installed.
<p>
Of course, I'll be doing all my examples in Perl, many using the excellent <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?WWW::Facebook::API">WWW::Facebook::API</a> module.

            <p><b>Perl 5.10.1 released</b><br>
I have a commitment to <a href="http://www.enlightenedperl.org/ironman.html">blog about Perl every week</a>, and this week I was really worried about what I'd write.  I've just returned from five weeks of International travel, and my scant time back in Melbourne has been spent <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pfenwick/sets/72157622100698168/">taking photos</a> at <a href="http://www.manifest.org.au/">Manifest</a>, rather than working on anything technical.
<p>
It's good that I haven't done anything newsworthy, because it would be completely over-ridden by the news that <b><a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2009/08/msg150172.html">Perl 5.10.1 has been released</a></b>.  This release has a special place in my heart, as 5.10.1 includes <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?autodie">autodie</a> as a core module, and as most of you know, I'm very fond of autodie.
<p>
I'm in the process of writing a "What's New in Perl 5.10.1" summary, which will appear as a <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/tips/">Perl Tip</a> in the next couple of days.

            <p><b>UK and Ireland thank-yous</b><br>
I've spent the last few days travelling around the UK and
Ireland,
and it's just been lovely.  By far one of the nicest things
about
travelling is the hospitality and generosity of the Perl
community,
and so I want to take a moment to say thank-you to a few special
people who made my travels so enjoyable.
<p>
Thank-you to Drew, Kimberley, and Samantha for giving up
their home
in Dublin, driving around two crazy Australians, and picking
us up
when we get completely lost.  An extra special thanks to
Kimberley
for some amazing cooking; it's not every day that we get to stay
with a professional chef!
<p>
Thank-you to Murray and Becky for giving us booze, conversation,
lodging, and wifi in their most amazing Edinburgh home.  I
really
wish I got to spend more time in Edinburgh; both the city
and its
people are beautiful, and haggis is plentiful and tasty.
<p>
Thank-you to Andy Armstrong for driving us around the
spectacular
English countryside, putting us up for the night (and sleeping
on the couch!), and then driving us on to Darlington.  Given the
cost of trains in the UK, Andy saved us a small fortune. 
Particular
thanks goes to Andy for the trip to 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall">Hadrian's
Wall</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vercovicium">Vercovicium</a>,
which was spectacular!
<p>
Thank-you to my Great Aunt Jennie, who isn't at all involved
in the Perl community, but gave us lunch, tea, great
conversation,
and acted as a guide for many miles of walking and photography
around Darlington.
<p>
Thank-you to the charity shop five minutes walk from Great Aunt
Jennie's house, which had an almost complete <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Hulk">Space
Hulk</a> 1st Edition
set with expansion cards for only &pound;1.50.
<p>
Thank-you to Smylers, for putting us up in Leeds, and in
particular
for putting up with me running off around the city with my
pirate
friends.
<p>
Finally, thank-you to L&eacute;on Brocard for organising a
London.pm meeting, and
for Piers Cawley for the lift to the airport.

            <p><b>YAPC::EU 2009 microreport</b><br>
I'm still travelling, and so I don't have a reliable sources of connectivity, time, or caffeine.  As such, this report is much briefer than I would like.
<p>
I made it to YAPC::EU 2009 and survived.  As my first YAPC ever, it was great to be at a conference where I could assume that everyone knew Perl.  It was also great to meet a number of the people who I'd been working with on-line for years, but never met in person.
<p>
It seems that lots of people use autodie.  That's good, because it's hard to gauge feelings and reactions on-line, but it's easy when a small group grabs one after a talk and asks detailed questions about its internals.  There seems to be a lot of demand for autodie to provide the ability for third-party code to see if it's enabled, and also a lot of demand (not least for me) for Perl to call a special method on exception objects if they're about to kill one's process, as opposed to be caught and handled.
<p>
The conference highlight for me were the people.  They were very warm, very willing to participate, and heckled only about things I could easily answer.  I suspect that means they were also being very nice, since they were a <i>very</i> knowledgeable audience.  Privately, everyone was extremely accommodating.  Apparently travelling from Australia makes one special, and I felt very special indeed from all the attention.
<p>
