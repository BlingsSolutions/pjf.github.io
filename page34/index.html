            <p><b>SAGE-AU 2006 wrap-up</b><br />
I'm home from <i>The Australian System Administrators Conference</i>, more commonly known as <a href="http://www.sage-au.org.au/conf/sage-au2006/">SAGE-AU 2006</a>.  This year the conference was held in Canberra, in the middle of winter, but since my entire time was spent indoors I didn't really have a chance to discover if the weather was as cold as it was supposed to be.
<p>
<a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a> often uses conferences as a way to boot-strap new courses, and this year the boot-strapped course was Perl for System Administration.  The full-day tutorial was held on Monday, and I stayed up rather late the night before getting the slides and materials just right.
<p>
During the tutorial I discovered that my audience had a lot more knowledge than I had anticipated, but this ended up being very good as I could cover more advanced topics in more depth, and more material overall.  I was also worried that the content wasn't SysAdmin-focused enough, but the great many comments I received after the course indicated otherwise.
<p>
The conference dinner this year was held in the ANZAC museum, which featured a great many original and recreated artifacts from WWII.  Overall it was a very sobering experience, despite the copious amounts of free alcoholic beverages that were available.
<p>
Lee Monette, SAGE-AU's administrative head and heart is moving on to greener pastures, and was given a standing ovation at the dinner for her amazing service to the guild throughout the years.  Lee's efficiency and organisation has been nothing less of astounding, and I am certain she'll have great success in her new adventures.
<p>
Friday morning at 9am I presented my paper on <i>Human Interfaces for Geeks</i>.  I try to put a little humour into my talks, although I wasn't sure how many laughs I'd get with everyone being hung-over from the dinner the night before.
<p>
I was very pleased to discover that SysAdmins keep their sense of humour even after a long night of festivities, and that many had woken "early" and consumed a great deal of caffeine to see my presentation.  The talk was extremely well received, with a great many laughs all around.  With luck, a few people may have even learnt a thing or two.
<p>
I'm now back in Melbourne, enjoying a beautiful weekend before starting on yet another hard-slog finishing our <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/courses/webdev.html">web development</a> course.  My plans are then to stop biting off huge chunks of coursework, and instead take the rest of the decade off.

Today I fly to <a href="http://perl.net.au/wiki/Canberra">Canberra</a> to teach <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/courses/perlsec.html">Perl Security</a>.
<p>
Tomorrow night I fly home from Canberra for the weekend.
<p>

<p>
After the conference I fly back home again.
<p>
I will then have a whole month in Melbourne, before flying out to Canberra <i>again</i> to teach <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/courses/webdev.html">Web Development with Perl</a>.

            <p><b><tt>system()</tt> made simple</b><br />
In preparation for an upcoming tutorial I'm presenting on using Perl for system administration, I'm looking at ways to make <tt>system()</tt> more simple to use.  Presently most developers have to go to quite a bit of work to check any command ran with <tt>system</tt> was successful, or worse yet they don't check at all.
<p>
The discussions regarding this matter can be found on <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.modules/;msgid=200606280258.k5S2wGHI026750[at]pause.perl.org">the modules list</a>, and on <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=557107">PerlMonks</a>.
I'm presently seeking as much feedback as possible, on the API, on names, and on ideas.
<p>
My overall goal is to make the <i>easiest</i> choice also the <i>most correct</i> choice for the vast majority of cases.  That means easy not only easy to write, but also easy for a developer to learn and comprehend.
<p>
<tt>brian d foy</tt> has already <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.modules/49625">provided feedback</a> on possible names via the modules list.  As much as it made me laugh, <tt>IPC::JFDI</tt> is probably going to be non-obvious to much of my target audience.  ;)
<p>
Feedback via the <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=557107">PerlMonks node</a> is preferable.
<p>
<b>Web Standards Group</b><br />
Melbourne has a Web Standards Group, and they have cool people, and free food!  Best of all, last night they even <a href="http://webstandardsgroup.org/meetings/index.cfm?event_id=67">let me present to them</a>, and laughed at my jokes.  I'm really amazed that I've been ignorant of their existence for so long.
