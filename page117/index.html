            <B>Smoking and thanks</b><BR>
I'd like to thank <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/fozbaca>fozbaca</a> for
his tips and how things look from the smoker's side of
things.  Unfortunately Kathryn tells me that she's given up
on giving up, which is a shame -- a week and a half with no
cigarettes is a very good start.
<P>
If Kathryn does decide to start again, I can feel safe in
the knowledge that I won't put any deadlines in front of
her.  Kathryn's job, as a member of the Support team, is to
put work in front of me.  (I've been doing a good job of
dodging it, though.)
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Linas has greatly increased the traffic on the mailing list
with some great ideas about historical quotes and non-http
quotes.  I've got lots of good things to be thinking about
now.  Linas even wants to do the web-page. I'm a happy boy.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
The company sponsored pizza, the employees purchased a huge
amount of drinks, and a good time was had by all.  I even
played a little <A
HREF=http://www.counter-strike.net>Counter-Strike</a>, but
quickly
stopped because Windows is just so damn annoying.  That and
Natedawg is too good and keeps whipping my butt.
<P>
Monday is a public holiday (yay!), and Tuesday Dan is due
back.
<P>
<B>Diplomacy</b><BR>
My goodness, due to popular demand we're going to start a
<i>third</i> play-by-e-mail <A
HREF=http://www.diplom.org/>Diplomacy</a> game here at
work.  It's amazing how much people are getting into it. 
Sometimes I think Ben speaks the truth when he says that
I've destroyed productivity with my silly strategy games.

I wish <A

all the best in giving up smoking.  Hang in there.
<P>
<B>House-hunting</b><BR>
Like <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/aaronl>aaronl</a>, I
also went looking at houses today.  Unlike aaronl, I was
looking at small 2 bedroom places, rather than ones with 16
fireplaces and a T1.
<P>
I didn't expect to be looking at houses at this time of
year, but this one in particular happened to catch my eye. 
It's in Preston (not <I>too</i> far from the city), has lots
of land, and is quite affordable.  The only problem is that
the house itself is quite small.  It should be fine for
Jacinta and myself to live there, but if Gwen were to move
in as well it would be rather cramped.
<P>
I'm going to arrange for a second inspection and if we still
like it we'll throw them an offer and see what they say.  I
would very dearly like to own my own house, and this place
certainly has enough space for livestock and vegetables to
keep me happy for a while.
<P>
<B>Melbourne geeks -- two degrees of separation</b><BR>
It seems that every geek I meet in Melbourne is related to
every other geek by at most one other person.  <A
HREF=http://www.glasswings.com.au/attendants.html>Katherine</a>
had her birthday party last night, and I met a girl there
named Nicole.  She ended up knowing me from when I worked at
the University of Melbourne, and I ended up knowing her
partner from when I was a student.

            <B>Smoking</b><BR>
I have an interesting dilemma at work.  Our new support
person, Kathryn, is an unsuccessful ex-smoker.  She gave up
for a while, but she's now buying and smoking cigarettes
again.  Since she wants to give up, I'd like to help Kathryn
beat her habit.  Unfortunately, it's hard to argue with
complete and utter unthinking physical addiction, and
nicotine addiction is about as strong as it gets.
<P>
I've never smoked, I've never had the desire, and I don't
intend to start.  I have had a family member die a painful
and protracted death from a smoking related illness, and I
don't think that experience is something I will ever
forget.  I can't think of very many worse ways to die.
<P>
I'm not an anti-smoking zealot, but if someone wants to give
up, then I'm seriously very happy to help them.  My dilemma
is that I don't know how.  I've tried taking Kathryn's
cigarettes, but she just buys more.  I've even offered to
trade her cigarettes for lollies and sugary things (Kathryn
has a sweet-tooth).  Alas, no luck so far.

            <B>Bughunting</b><BR>
<A HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/sw>Sam</a> managed to
find the REAL bug-of-doom that I had spent so long looking
for.  It ended up that our daemon had opened a couple of
unix-domain sockets before forking, and the children
inherited and used the open file descriptors.  Due to the
nature of the code this was okay during quiet periods, but
caused huge problems during load.  Sam was presented with
the Bugfinder's Beer and everyone is happy.  Good work Sam!
<P>
<B>Diplomacy</b><BR>
Very interesting turn.  It seemed that everyone lied to
everyone, and a very messy turn was had by all.  What fun! 
I'm looking forward to see how it all turns out.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
I'm very thankful to Jacinta for her work.  She's spent a
lot of time cleaning up code, making sure things are
consistant, and reviewing my hacker's guide and other
documentation.
<P>
I'm playing with Debianising Finance::Quote, although it
will probably be a while before I get the proper hang of
it.  I've got some examples to work by, so I'm using them.
<P>
<B>Cartooning</b><BR>
I'm once again walking the fine line and have restarted my
cartoons.

Watched <I>LG-5: City in Space</i>, a 3D movie at the IMAX

great.
<P>
Watched <I>Episode I: The Phantom Menace</i> on tape.  The
special effects were good, but the movie SUCKED!  George
Lucas has certainly turned to the dark side, I'm sure of
it.  I delayed watching TPM for a long time because everyone
else told me it was bad, but I had no idea just how truly
bad it was.  Somehow I feel that <A

<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Got heaps of coding done over the weekend.  Still needs a
lot of polish before the next release, but we're certainly
getting there.  Haven't heard back from Jon about The Perl
Journal article I'm supposed to be writing yet.  Will send
him another letter about it.
