Had a good night of hacking, and fixed a number of items I
had outstanding on my list of jobs.
<P>
One thing that had me stumped for a while was with the
Yahoo::Europe module.  Xose had provided me with a working
set of code which rolls all the hard parts of Yahoo lookups
into a common base, and even squeezes out a bunch of
complexity to boot.  However, the code Xose provided me
with, and the code that Yahoo::Europe used, didn't make use 
of all the data available from Yahoo.  I was pretty certain
there wasn't much difference between the European Yahoo
stock scripts and those from Yahoo USA, so I figured that it
should be easy to have them both fetch the same data.
<P>
Unfortunately, while the idea was simple in theory, it
proved to be a bit more of a challenge in practice.  The
data I got back on the European stocks had field mismatches
and data corruption.  Very odd, especially considering I was
getting the same information fine through the webpage.
<P>
I eventually found the problem.  F::Q was fetching the
information from Yahoo's French site, and the French
apparently use commas rather than periods as their decimal
point.  This is fine, except when exporting decimal
information into a comma-delimited file.  Fetching the
information from Yahoo UK fixed the problem immediately.
<P>
<B>Diplomacy</b><BR>
The third game has started, and I've been watching some of
the politics going on as the impartial arbitrator.  I'm
having a ball watching how everyone's trying to make things
work for them.
<P>
The game I'm playing in has just got very interesting. 
Junwei got stabbed by Phil, so the next year or so should be
very interesting.  I have to admit, Phil has guts.  He
wasn't happy just to stab the largest power in the game, he
also sent out an attack force against the second largest
power as well.  It will be interesting to see how this all
turns out.

Ben showed me a short video of skateboarders who didn't
quite make
their tricks.  I think councils who don't want skaters
hanging around would do well to take a look at this video. 
Rather than putting up signs saying "No skating, fine $200",
they could instead put up signs saying "Grinding a bar and
failing could permanently separate you from your
reproductive organs."  Any desire I had to do skateboarding
tricks completely drained away from me after watching Ben's
short vid.

Well, you tell me.  You're the one who's going

<B>Food</b><BR>
One cannot live off wedding cake alone.  I tried that today,
and it didn't make me feel any better.
<P>
<B>Banks</b><BR>
Looks like the banks approve me in principal, but want the
paperwork and the actual house before signing on the line. 
This is pretty much what I expect, and that the banks tell
me that I'm "very comfortably within my limits" is
reassuring.
<P>
The Real Estate agents still need to send me a complete
Section 32, the one they gave me was missing the rates
notices.  Interesting that the notice of rates also usually
contains a valuation by the council.  I wonder if they're
trying to hide something?

Woke up on Saturday with a bit of a sniffly nose.  Ignored
it for the day.  Woke up on Sunday with a more sniffly
nose.  I figured I wouldn't let a sniffly nose tell me what
to do, so I cycled 25-30km and then hauled myself up some
walls.  Interestingly enough this got rid of the sniffles
for a while.  Woke up this morning and the sniffly nose was
back, and it's currently being kept at bay with a mixture of
codeine and other chemicals, which have also dropped my
sensory perception significantly.
<P>
<B>Houses and stuff</b><BR>
Things seem to be going okay.  I'm awaiting a few
phone-calls from the banks to say that they like me enough,
and then I'll be making an offer on the property.  I'm
feeling a lot better about the whole thing now.  Even if we
don't buy the house I feel a lot better off for the
experience, knowing how everything works.
<P>
I'm sorry to hear that <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/ajv>ajv</a> is having
problems getting a home-loan.  If it's any help, the banks
seemed to be much happier when I mentioned that I was
poached by my current employer.
<P>
<B>Rockclimbing</b><BR>
Jacinta managed to climb the "training wall", which is the
first of the big walls out at Nunawading.  This is
excellent, and I'm very proud of Jacinta's efforts.  She was
rewarded with a free mexican meal.
<P>
<B>Fish</b><BR>
Dan Golembo was telling me about fish in Russia that are
harvested for "black caviar".  Apparently one of these fish
can contain as much as 100kg of caviar -- which makes it one
HUGE fish.  Unfortunately it seems that the fish are being
hunted to the brink of extinction, as the black caviar is
such a sought-after commodity, and their natural habitat is
becoming polluted.
<P>
Remind me not to wrestle any Russian fish in the future.

                <B>Work</b><BR>
Yesterday, Sharon "left", which is executive talk for being
made redundant.  Nothing was announced, and I thought the
only reason Sharon wasn't around was because she's in the
middle of her exam period right now.  What makes things
worse is that nothing was said in the staff meeting today,
it was only afterwards via e-mail that this was announced.
<P>
This is a very bad sign, and goes completely against our
"Company Values", which I feel some executives desperately
need to read.  It may well have been that Sharon wished to
move on anyway, but the way it was handled with the rest of
the company was awful.  A few months ago there would have
been cakes, drinks, proper announcements that someone was
leaving, speeches and thank-yous, and generally a chance for
everyone to wish them the best for the future.  I hope this
isn't the start of other employees "disappearing" with maybe
a short note on the news list to testify their passing.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
We finally have our <A
HREF="http://finance-quote.sourceforge.net">new webpage</a>
thanks to Ben.  It looks really pretty, although I've just
discovered that it's unreadable unless you have stylesheets
turned on.  The good news is that it looks fine in lynx.
<P>
Unfortunately, the page has very little in the way of
content, although this is not Ben's fault.  The <A
HREF="http://finance-quote.sourceforge.net/index.old.html">original
design</a> forwarded to me by Ben had lots more content, and
although it was true, it wasn't quite as appropriate.
<P>
Still haven't had a chance to hack at code yet.  Been too
busy with house matters.
<P>
<B>GnuCash</b><BR>
Showed Sofie GnuCash today, in exchange for a promised
massage for Jacinta and myself on the weekend.  Sofie claims
that she can probably skip most of her accounting homework
simply by typing it into GnuCash, and has asked me to
install it on her machine.
<P>
<B>Banks</b><BR>
All the banks seem to be happy to lend me much more money
than I want.  This is probably a good thing.
