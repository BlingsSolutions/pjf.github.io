            <B>Movies</b><BR>
Watched <I>LG-5: City in Space</i>, a 3D movie at the IMAX
theatre.  The special effects were good, but the plot wasn't
great.
<P>
Watched <I>Episode I: The Phantom Menace</i> on tape.  The
special effects were good, but the movie SUCKED!  George
Lucas has certainly turned to the dark side, I'm sure of
it.  I delayed watching TPM for a long time because everyone
else told me it was bad, but I had no idea just how truly
bad it was.  Somehow I feel that <A
HREF=http://www.teleport-city.com/movies/reviews/bizarro/starwars.html>The
Star Wars Christmas Special</a> had to have been better than
this.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Got heaps of coding done over the weekend.  Still needs a
lot of polish before the next release, but we're certainly
getting there.  Haven't heard back from Jon about The Perl
Journal article I'm supposed to be writing yet.  Will send
him another letter about it.

            <B>CVS</b><BR>
I'm always amazed in interviews when people tell me that in
their previous jobs they didn't use a revision control
system.  I can't imagine doing any sort of serious coding
without CVS.  If I were any better friends with CVS then I'd
probably be sleeping with it.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Made a tiny branch for Finance::Quote 0.18, GnuCash
edition.  F::Q was originally part of GnuCash, and a few
months ago I
branched it off into its own development.  I still roll the
changes back into the GnuCash tree, but they require minor
changes here and there.  It's amazing how the words "feature
freeze" can get me to start hacking code again. :)
<P>
<B>Rockclimbing and Hackey-sack</b><BR>
Ian injured his arm playing hackey-sack.  I don't know how
that's possible, considering that you don't even use your
arms in hackey-sack, but Ian did it nonetheless.  As such,
he dropped out of climbing this week.  :(
<P>
<B>Perl</b><BR>
<I>Makes simple jobs easy, makes hard jobs possible</i>.  My
goodness, I really do love perl sometimes.  Just simple
things like being able to throw around references to
anonymous functions can really make a man's day.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Spent an entire day on things political.  I really didn't
join this company to spend my days arguing politics, I
actually joined it to code.  Unfortunately the culture,
values, and many other reasons why I joined have been
eroded.  Dan is coming back on Monday, and while I'm sure
he'll be able to fix some problems, he won't be able to fix
all of them.
<P>
I'm working on plans should the conditions at Schoolsnet
become unworkable, and how to try and stop the decline
before that happens.  I don't really want to leave -- I love
the people here and what's left of the culture, but at the
same time I don't want to be working for some corporate
juggernaut.

            <B>GnuCash</b><BR>
Seems the reason why the GnuCash mailing list has been so
quiet recently is that I was somehow dropped off the list
with a number of other developers.  This is very odd.
<P>
Dave reminded me that GnuCash is going into a feature freeze
on Sunday, so it looks like Saturday I'll be coding and
rolling.
<P>
Unfortunately the latest GnuCash from the CVS tree seems to
have a couple of bugs that are making double-entry
impossible.  Since double-entry is the best thing since
sliced accountants, I might have to return to the previous
version for a little while.
<P>
<B>Food</b><BR>
Jacinta's liver cleansing diet is doing wonders... I arrive
home each night to a well planned and almost prepared meal. 
Jacinta's even doing the dishes for me so that she has
things to cook with.  I wonder when she'll realise that if
she's doing the cooking then I guess I should be doing the
cleaning...  I hope she doesn't, because I hate cleaning. 
Maybe I can convince Gwen to do the cleaning instead?

            <B>Hackey-sack</b><BR>
The Vice-President of Marketing now plays hackey-sack.  This
is a good thing.  Mind you, it's not too surprising,
either.  AJ also plays Half-Life and Diplomacy.
<P>
<B>TPJ</b><BR>
Received an e-mail from Jon Orwant asking if I'd be
interested in writing an article for <A
HREF=http://www.itknowledge.com/tpj/>The Perl Journal</a>
about Finance::Quote.  I tried to send a more intelligent
reply than just "<I>Hell Yeah!</i>", which was my initial
response.
<P>
<B>Bugs</b><BR>
Damn hisenbugs resurrecting themselves.  Unfortunately
finding bugs that only occur "infrequently, and for no good
reason" is a very tricky process.
<P>
<B>Gardening</b><BR>
Compost heap is full.  A year's worth of hard work has
turned foodscraps and garden waste into a huge amount of
beautiful vermicast (worm poo).  The effects of this stuff
is impressive, but my supply outstrips my demand at my
current property (tiny back-yard).
<P>
I'd love to move somewhere with more space, but I don't want
to go from rented property to rented property.  This
probably means I should start looking at houses again, and
maybe re-evaluating my financial situation since Gwen is
living with us now.  Mind you, I have no idea how long Gwen
will be staying, so any calculations I make should err
strongly on the side of caution (then again, they always
do).
