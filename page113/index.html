            <B>DVDs</b><BR>
I noticed that <A
HREF="http://www.advogato.net/person/dancer">Dancer</a> is
lamenting the region restrictions on DVD players.  I've
heard a rumour that the players in New Zealand do not come
with region restrictions as the NZ government classifies
such stupidities as a trade restriction, anti-competitive,
or something else it believes is illegal.  Yay NZ if this is
true.  Anyone care to confirm/deny the rumour?
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Pain.  Deep pain.  Working on a bug in some archaic code
that seems to have been invented before anyone heard of
encapsulation or local variables.  It hurts.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote and GnuCash</b><BR>
Will be looking at tinkering GnuCash to use the new release
of Finance::Quote.  This should make people very happy.
<P>
I'm also thinking of writing a C interface to the library
(yes, you can do this with perl).

            <B>Finance::Quote v1.00 at last!</b><BR>
At last Finance::Quote 1.00 has been released and is
available for public consumption.  Along with the new
release I've also updated the <A
HREF="http://finance-quote.sourceforge.net/">Finance::Quote
website</a>  so that it's not quite so content-poor.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.advogato.net/person/scottp">Scotty</a>
is right that it takes a fair bit of time to release a
project.  I spent the better part of an hour or two
uploading changelogs and writing announcements.
<P>
I guess now it's time for me to chase down Jon about that
Perl Journal Article.
<P>
<B>Roguelike games</b><BR>
Lost my extremely-good monk in ADOM because I wasn't
thinking.  If you ever come across a level filled with
corpses, you <I>should</i> be thinking "why are all these
monsters dead?" instead of thinking "buffet dinner" and
waiting for a banshee to sneak up and wail at you.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
I've been most proud of young TIm, who's started the
conversion to full geekdom.   Tim's been staying back at
work much too late so that he can hack with his Linux
boxen.  There's been some talk of moving him into systems to
replace <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/rcp>Ross</a>.  I'm
hoping to throw Tim with a few programming texts before that
happens.  :)

            <B>Work</b><BR>
After a small discussion on slashdot I realised that if I
were to take up contracting and work 1-2 days a week on
average, I could happily maintain my current lifestyle
(although I won't really be saving any money).  This seems
incredibly attractive, as a 5-day weekend every week would
give me lots of time to do more fulfilling things than
writing code for someone else.  I'll need to sit down and
figure out all the pros and cons of this scenario.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
One, maybe two bits of documentation to go, and some easy
code changes and testing.  While the next release could be
happily called version 0.19, I'm considering bumping it up
to 1.00 because I now consider it stable, good, and
flexible.  A 0.xx number always seems to imply "under
development", whereas the core of F::Q has matured quite a
bit.

We made an offer on the house, and someone else made an
offer for the full asking price, so they got it.  I'm not
too upset, as there are plenty of other nicer houses out
there, and in a few months time I'll be in a much better
position to buy.  What I find interesting is that both Ian
and Sofie, and Benni and Tara are looking at buying houses
now.  It's almost looking like a Monopoly game.
<P>
<B>Banks</b><BR>
One of the banks who I was talking about home-loans with
wants to give me a complimentary credit card with an
outrageously large credit limit.  I'll be handing it back to
them.
<P>
<B>Diplomacy</b><BR>
Junwei is winning, and after this game I am going to have to
take lessons from him about how he does this.  Italy (Phil)
is eating out of Junwei's hand, and is probably going to
spur Junwei on to victory.  I think we're going to have a
hard time convincing Phil that possibly losing is better
than helping Junwei and definitely losing.  Unfortunately
being the second largest power, everything thinks I'm trying
to nobble Junwei so that I can win.  The truth is I want to
nobble Junwei so that I don't lose.  I'm much rather force
Junwei to draw than have him win the game.  I'm researching
stalemate lines to see what I can do.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Negotiating with Dan to try and get a nine day fortnight. 
Believe it or not, I actually want more of a life.  There's
been a lot of proceedural stuff flying around recently, and
not all of it is stable yet.  It should be good once it is, 
because as bug-boy I want quality more than most.
<P>
A legacy version of one of our products is now finally
finished, the customers using it having upgraded to the
latest and greatest.  This makes me very happy.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Spent some time at CERES (a beautiful environmental park)
and hacked together a lot more of the documentation.  The
project is almost ready for release, but I need to find some
spare time where <A HREF=http://www.adom.de/>ADOM</a>
doesn't tempt me too much so I can finish it.  I should also
get in contact with Jon again about The Perl Journal
article.
<P>
<B>Ian</b><BR>
Ian has his new car, and he's so proud.  I want him to act
as taxi-boy this weekend for rockclimbing.

<B>Rockclimbing</b><BR>
Finally climbed Cretin, and (after Ian and Ben's most
helpful advice) discovered that it was much easier than
expected.
<P>
<B>Hacky-sack</b><BR>
We have a <I>lot</i> of skill in Schoolsnet now.  I'm very
proud of everyone.  To quote Natedawg, <I>"We have the
