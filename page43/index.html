                <p><b>Space Hulk</b><br />
When I was much younger I spent some time playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Hulk">Space Hulk</a>, a boardgame by Games Workshop set in the Warhammer 40k universe.
<p>
Unfortunately Space Hulk is well out of print, and Games Workshop themselves describe the game as <a href="http://us.games-workshop.com/games/40k/gaming/spacehulk/default.htm">long gone</a>.  One would think this would pose a challenge to a gamer who wants to play again, but doesn't own a set.  Thankfully, it doesn't.
<p>
Games Workshop have been wonderful people and made the <a href="http://us.games-workshop.com/games/40k/gaming/spacehulk/tiles.htm">old Space Hulk tiles</a> available for download.  Using a colour printer, a glue-stick, some cardboard, scissors and a lot of patience, I managed to put together my very own Space Hulk board pieces.
<p>
Armed with an inventory of what was originally in the box, I managed to find enough tokens from other games to use as blips, and a friend brought over a box of Hero Quest minatures and doors.  Combined with a compednium of old rules from another gamer, first edition Space Hulk lived once more!

All the <a href="http://use.perl.org/~Allison/journal/29157">other</a> <a href="http://use.perl.org/~Alias/journal/29129">cool</a> <a href="http://use.perl.org/~cog/journal/29130">kids</a> are doing it.  Of course, I'm running for <a href="http://melbourne.pm.org/">Melbourne Perl Mongers</a> secretary, and not <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</a> president.  The original copy of this announcement can be found in the <a href="http://mail.pm.org/pipermail/melbourne-pm/2006-April/001954.html">Melbourne.PM archives</a>
&lt;hr/&gt;<p>
G'day everyone,
<p>
I'm afraid that I won't be able to attend the Melbourne.PM AGM on the 10th of
May, as I have a prior commitment to be in Sydney teaching people how to use
Perl.  As such, I want to apologise for my absence in advance.
<p>
However, Melbourne.PM is an organisation that I care about very much, one that
I've been heavily involved in since it resurfaced in December 2001.  If you've
been to a few meetings or spent some time on the mailing list, then you've
probably seen me speak or post.  As you are no doubt aware, I'm deeply
passionate about Perl, and about the Perl community.  That's you.
<p>
I'm going to be running for the position of Secretary at the Melbourne.PM AGM,
and I want to let everyone know why.  In particular, I want people to have the
chance to also stand for the position of secretary if they disagree with me, and
for the membership to have a choice as to who they elect.
<p>
My primary goal as Melbourne.PM secretary is obviously to ensure that
Melbourne.PM grows as an organisation, is rewarding to its members, and
encourages and supports participation in Perl and the Perl community.  I started
using Perl more than ten years ago because it was a fun language, and I want to
make sure it's fun to be involved in our user group.
<p>
However I also have a few goals with regards to the organisation of Melbourne.PM
itself.  I want to try and make it open and transparent and accessible as
possible for all members.  I'd like to encourage everyone to become involved and
have a hand in its running.
<p>
In particular, I'd like for the committee itself to become a lot more open, and
a lot better defined in its roles and responsibilities.  I want to make sure
that people who want to help have the opportunity to do so, and those who want
to take a greater hand in running the group can, even if they're not elected
members themselves.
<p>
In particular, I'd like to work towards implementing the following for the new
committee:

                <p><b>University degrees</b><br />
I've been doing an awful lot of <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">teaching</a> these last few weeks, and part of it has made me think a little more about university degrees, and whether or not they're useful.
<p>
I had a great time at university, and am very happy with both what I had learnt in my degree and the social connections that I made.  However I also have a number of friends and associated who are very successful and skilled, but have no tertiary qualifications at all.  Indeed, my first year computer science teacher explained that if we <i>really</i> wanted to make money we should have left school at sixteen to become bricklayers.  There's a shortage of bricklayers, and by the time we would be graduating our bricklaying alter-egos would be running their own tax-effective business and own three houses.
<p>
So, is it really worthwhile spending three or more years of your life to get a piece of paper?  For the individual I really can't say, but for a trainer with a class filled with postgraduates, the answer is yes.  Hell yes!
<p>
My class of recent graduates learnt <i>much</i> faster than any other class I can remember.  We covered four days worth of material in a mere three days, and spent the extra day covering extra theory and object oriented design in Perl.  Regardless of the rewards to the attendees, it was a very rewarding experience for myself.
<p>
Now, it could just be luck that I had a particularly smart class, but I think the fact that most were fresh out of university was a factor.  If nothing else, holding a university degree shows that you know how to learn and absorb knowledge, and are able to adapt to new situations.  I know that should almost be self-obvious, but it's not something I had encountered in such a stunning way until recently.
<p>
<b>Perlish dreams</b><br />
I have strange dreams sometimes, and usually I forget them.  But last night's one stuck in my head.  I was at a conference, and <a href="http://pugs.blogs.com/pugs/">Audrey Tang</a> was giving a presentation.  Not just any presentation, but the best presentation I had ever seen in my life.  It was truly spectacular, and used many new presentation techniques I had never before encountered.
<p>
I was saddened by the end of the presentation, not only because it was so good, but because if I took my new-found techniques everyone would know that I lifted them directly from Audrey's keynote.  They just won't be as cool.
<p>
It took me 90 minutes after waking up to realise that the whole thing was a dream, and that I could use these great new techniques and have them appear original!
<p>
My happiness lasted but a few mere seconds before it also dawned upon me that unicode doesn't have <a href="http://www.frozen-bubble.org/">frozen bubble</a> glyphs.  And even if it did, "<tt>&amp;penguin; &amp;penguin; &amp;orangeball; &amp;igloo;</tt>" probably wouldn't be a valid Perl 6 program, regardless of how much cool stuff it did in my dream.

Sofie and Ian are having a baby (in five or six months time), and I've finally been told I have permission to tell the world.  ;)  Congratulations to them both!

<p><b>Semi-retirement is hard work</b><br/>
In my <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=457&count=1">last entry</a> I proudly proclaimed that due to sound lifestyle management, investments, and business decisions, I only really need to do about 15 days of work each year.  I could finally sit back, relax, and enjoy a peaceful lifestyle without undue pressure of complications.  Therefore it's ironic that my relaxing lifestyle should begin with three months of non-stop, high-stress work.
<p>
This coming week I'm conducting a <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/courses/programmingperl.html">training course</a>.  The week after I'm doing the same, for another client.  The week after that I'm conducting a <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/courses/perloo.html">different training course</a> for a different client again.
<p>
Finishing my three weeks of teaching, I then have four weeks of consulting, followed by anything from 1-3 weeks of training in Sydney, and then a week of training in Darwin.  Oh yes, I also have a <a href="http://www.sage-au.org.au/conf/sage-au2006/">conference tutorial</a> or two that I need to write.
<p>
While I certainly can't complain about having the good fortune of getting so much training into such a short period of time, I am certainly looking forward to taking a break at the end of it.
<p>
<b>Min-maxing enjoyment</b><br />
My leisure activity of choice has recently caused me some confusion.  Traditionally all my leisure activities have taken time, and many have taken money.  One can convert the money component into a time component using a number of different methods, and thereby obtain an overall score in enjoyment gained per unit of overall time.  I would hope that most people do this unconciously to some degree, thereby choosing forms of leisure that are most appropriate for their lifestyle and financial situation.
<p>
My regular forms of entertainment have been fairly static throughout my life.  Games of all sorts are high on the list, including RPGs, boardgames, on-line games, and regular computer games.  Competitive games feature highly, and somehow whenever I find myself playing a MMORPG I often find myself exploiting economic holes for personal gain, often though resource speculation and control.
<p>
Social interactions with friends are also a mainstay, although an increasing number of friends have got themselves lives, some going as far as partners, jobs, houses, and even children.  Diving has been my high-expense leisure activity for the last few years; it happens infrequently, but it's worth it.
<p>
In the last month of two I discovered yet another leisure activity, but one that's been <i>generating</i> money rather than consuming it.  The amount that it generates is only a fraction of even my poorest consulting work, yet its entertainment value is moderately high, and the overall income I've been gaining is equal to about half my normalised expenditure.
<p>
The downside is that my new leisure activity is socially dull.  There's no social interaction to speak of, and nothing in the terms of interesting anecdotes that can be told afterwards.  There are also learning curves and sweet-spots that have a significant impact on return-on-investment, so the hobby itself requires a reasonable time commitment to be worthwhile.  I'm concerned that it will turn me into a very dull person.
<p>
I'm planning to combat this by organising a number of very social, and very geeky, gaming events with my friends once I finish my current glut of work.  I'm going to try and tempt them away from their jobs and loved ones to indulge in some really serious gaming.  I'd really love to have friends over for long weekend LAN-parties, but I need a little more space for this to do this properly.  Perhaps we'll need to do some renovating to provide for more space, our backyard is certainly large enough that we could easily extend onto it.

In my <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=457&count=1">last entry</a> I proudly proclaimed that due to sound lifestyle management, investments, and business decisions, I only really need to do about 15 days of work each year.  I could finally sit back, relax, and enjoy a peaceful lifestyle without undue pressure of complications.  Therefore it's ironic that my relaxing lifestyle should begin with three months of non-stop, high-stress work.
<p>
This coming week I'm conducting a <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/courses/programmingperl.html">training course</a>.  The week after I'm doing the same, for another client.  The week after that I'm conducting a <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/courses/perloo.html">different training course</a> for a different client again.
<p>
Finishing my three weeks of teaching, I then have four weeks of consulting, followed by anything from 1-3 weeks of training in Sydney, and then a week of training in Darwin.  Oh yes, I also have a <a href="http://www.sage-au.org.au/conf/sage-au2006/">conference tutorial</a> or two that I need to write.
<p>
While I certainly can't complain about having the good fortune of getting so much training into such a short period of time, I am certainly looking forward to taking a break at the end of it.
<p>
<b>Min-maxing enjoyment</b><br />
My leisure activity of choice has recently caused me some confusion.  Traditionally all my leisure activities have taken time, and many have taken money.  One can convert the money component into a time component using a number of different methods, and thereby obtain an overall score in enjoyment gained per unit of overall time.  I would hope that most people do this unconciously to some degree, thereby choosing forms of leisure that are most appropriate for their lifestyle and financial situation.
<p>
My regular forms of entertainment have been fairly static throughout my life.  Games of all sorts are high on the list, including RPGs, boardgames, on-line games, and regular computer games.  Competitive games feature highly, and somehow whenever I find myself playing a MMORPG I often find myself exploiting economic holes for personal gain, often though resource speculation and control.
<p>
Social interactions with friends are also a mainstay, although an increasing number of friends have got themselves lives, some going as far as partners, jobs, houses, and even children.  Diving has been my high-expense leisure activity for the last few years; it happens infrequently, but it's worth it.
<p>
In the last month of two I discovered yet another leisure activity, but one that's been <i>generating</i> money rather than consuming it.  The amount that it generates is only a fraction of even my poorest consulting work, yet its entertainment value is moderately high, and the overall income I've been gaining is equal to about half my normalised expenditure.
<p>
The downside is that my new leisure activity is socially dull.  There's no social interaction to speak of, and nothing in the terms of interesting anecdotes that can be told afterwards.  There are also learning curves and sweet-spots that have a significant impact on return-on-investment, so the hobby itself requires a reasonable time commitment to be worthwhile.  I'm concerned that it will turn me into a very dull person.
<p>
I'm planning to combat this by organising a number of very social, and very geeky, gaming events with my friends once I finish my current glut of work.  I'm going to try and tempt them away from their jobs and loved ones to indulge in some really serious gaming.  I'd really love to have friends over for long weekend LAN-parties, but I need a little more space for this to do this properly.  Perhaps we'll need to do some renovating to provide for more space, our backyard is certainly large enough that we could easily extend onto it.
