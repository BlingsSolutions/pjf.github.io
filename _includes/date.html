        Note: The date should be formatted exactly as it's shown below. In particular, the
        "least significant" characters of the month should be encapsulated in a <span>
        element to denote what gets dropped in 1200px mode (eg. the "uary" in "January").
        Oh, and if you don't need a date for a particular page or post you can simply delete
        the entire "date" element.
