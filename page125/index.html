            <B>Advogato</b><BR>
Like <A HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/ajv/>ajv</a>,
I've been dumped back to Observer status again.  I'm getting
a little used to this funny certification thing now -- it
seems to come in waves.
<P>
<B>Rockclimbing</b><BR>
Went with Ian, Benni and Dan (not Dan from work) to <A
HREF=http://www.themill.com.au>The Mill</a>.  The people
were very nice, some of the walls were fun, but I'll admit
that <A HREF=http://www.hardrock.com.au>Hardrock</a> remains
my favourite.  Still, The Mill is an easy bike-ride from
where I live (as is <A
HREF=http://www.vicranges.com.au>VicRanges</a>), whereas
Hardrock is yonks away.
<P>
In what appears to be a common occurance, I met up with some
old people I knew while Rockclimbing and got talking.  One
of them happened to do a study of one of Schoolsnet's
products as part of his thesis, and has promised to pass his
research on to me.  I look forward to reading it.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
It was a weekend, but nobody seems to have told Scotty
that.  I received two phone-calls from Scott about some data
conversion scripts I had written.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
The <A HREF=http://www.asx.com.au/>ASX</a> seems to have
broken their on-line share prices, which explains why some
of my regression tests were failing.  I've been doing a lot
of thinking about the module, but not a lot of coding.  The
code needs more ways to signal that something has gone
wrong, and what that wrongness is.
<P>
Played a little with Perl/Tk, but not seriously.  I'd like
to have a nice stock-ticker, but I don't want to write it
myself.  The tickers which I've played with didn't support
Australian stocks very well.

            <B>Catch-up</b><BR>
This is mainly a catch-up diary.  I've been very busy
recently and haven't had much chance to write in my diary as
much as I'd like.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Just call me bug-boy.  If it's a bug, then give it to me.  I
don't have enough of them already.  If it's a
hard-to-reproduce bug, then that's even better.
<P>
In seriousness it looks like Dancer and myself have a hold
on bug #2.  This is a very good thing.  Clemo has offered to
name his firstborn children after us.
<P>
Dan and Tiff are leaving today to get married.  I wish them
all the very best.  I'm glad they're getting a break from
work at last.
<P>
<B>Rock-climbing</b><BR>
Clemo, Ian and Sam went rockclimbing with me last night. 
Lots of fun, it's so nice to be back on the walls again.  I
was very pleased with some the climbs I achieved, and Sam
showed himself to be a natural climber starting with some of
the walls it took me weeks to work up to.
<P>
We should get another Schoolsnet crowd at rockclimbing next
week, too.  Should be good.
<P>
<B>Dinner</b><BR>
Had dinner with an old friend and watched lots of cute
anime.  Brought back memories of the good ol' days when I
was a poor student and couldn't afford a life.
<P>
<B>Games</b><BR>
Ian's given me HomeWorld to play.  It's a very pretty game,
although I've never been good at real-time strategy games. 
I more prefer the hours of thought and consideration that
turn-based games afford.  In that vein, I've been thinking
of starting a Diplomacy game here at work, depending upon
how interested people are.

            <B>Finance::Quote/GnuCash</b><BR>
A question came up on the GnuCash mailing list asking how
difficult it would be to convert stocks listed on foreign
exchanges into local currency when the stock-prices are
updated.  I thought it was an excellent question and an
issue well worth addressing.
<P>
After a bit of hacking, I managed to clobber out a very
rough (but working) currency converter for Finance::Quote. 
It's going to be changed to make it nicer, but I managed to
write a trivial application which can convert between two
currencies on the command-line.
<P>
Did lots of tidy-up work on Finance::Quote.  Added testing
scripts and fixed the documentation and made a few code
optimisations.  I'll probably release a new version shortly,
with currency-conversion support due for the version after
that.
<P>
The joy of coding has kept me up past midnight.  I must be
getting to sleep.

The bug is still dead.  Testing says it's dead.  Everybody's
happy.
<P>
Now that I've fixed a problem (with Dancer's help) on this
particular product, I've now been forwarded the other bugs
with it. I don't want the other bugs.  I don't know the
code.  I have other bugs outstanding in my main line of
work.  I've even gained a new nickname based upon a typo of
the product's name -- I'm now being called 'Lover Boy'.
<P>
People with competing bugs are trying to get me off the
project.  I hope they succeed.

The final bug in a project that had been repeatedly coming
back to bite me has died at last.  The bug has been causing
many people (including myself) grief for many months -- and
would only show itself at the most inappropriate times.  I
think the bug is gone for good, and hopefully exhaustive
testing should back me up there.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Cooper Vertz submitted a patch to extend the Yahoo! quote
facilities somewhat.  Patches always make me happy, and I've
integrated Cooper's change into the CVS source.
<P>
Ben's also been bugging me to spiff-up one of my example
programs so he can easily see how his share portfolio is
going.  It was an easy request that I made while waiting for
<I>the world's slowest toaster</i>, one of the quality
pieces of kitchen equipment we have here at work.
<P>
