            <B><A HREF="http://finance-
quote.sourceforge.net">Finance::Quote</a></b><BR>
1.06 was released yesterday, and despite a few hiccups with 
<A HREF="http://pause.perl.org/">PAUSE</a> (the CPAN upload 
tool), and <A HREF="http://www.sf.net/">SourceForge</a>'s 
database, it all went quite smoothly.
<P>
I'm chuffed at how many people are sending me source code 
and feedback.  I've got to look into setting up a better 
infrastructure so that Quotelets (the modules that run with 
F::Q) can be distributed and updated seperately to the main 
release.
<P>
Discovered that F::Q even gets a mention in a <A 
HREF="http://ironbark.bendigo.latrobe.edu.au/subjects/bitwen
/lectures/l21.d/Lect21.html">lecture stream</a> at LaTrobe 
University in Bendigo.  That made me smile.
<P>
<B>Garden</b><BR>
Water tank (1030 litres) arrived today.  Will be installed 
and operational next week.  Should provide us with a plenty 
big supply of water.
<P>
Divided the rhubarb, and as such have oodles of rhubarb 
that we're trying to use up.  Crown segments have gone into 
our front garden, our neighbours garden, and the place 
where the rhubarb was originally.  Provided that they don't 
all die, I'll be extremely happy.
<P>
<B>Fire Safety</b><BR>
Four new smoke detectors in the house, rather than the one 
dodgy one that came with the place.  Going to have to move 
the one in the hallway as it's blocking one of the 
cupboards doors.  (Only noticed that one AFTER I'd screwed 
the thing to the ceiling.)

            <B>Rabbit SNAX for dogs(TM)</b><BR>
New <I>Rabbit SNAX for dogs</i>(TM) are a delicious and
nutritous snack for your dog.  <I>SNAX</i> are 100% natural
and filled with vitamins, minerals, and the goodness of
fibre to help your dog grow.  Forumulated specially for
fussy eaters, <I>Rabbit SNAX for dogs</i>(TM) are made from real
rabbits, and are cruelty-free!  Available now from your
Coburg geek household.
<P>
<B>Homebrew</b><BR>
We've drunk about 50% of our first batch of beer, and that a
lot of it was before the three weeks of aging has something
to say for its quality.  Our brewed lemonade has just been
bottled, and we now have a cider bubbling away in the
fermenter which will be ready for bottling in a couple of weeks.
<P>
<B>Consluting</b><BR>
Yup, I'm still a conslutant.  Doing some work for some most
excellent people who I used to work with at schnet.
<P>
<B>Games</b><BR>
Had a bit of a play on the Sullon Zek Everquest PvP server.
 Very different to regular PvE play, and a hell of a lot of fun.
<P>
<B>Open Source</b><BR>
I suck.

changed the sheets and blankets on our bed.  Good rabbit.

            <B>Mozilla</b><BR>
Have started using Mozilla again.  Went off it a while ago
because it was a little too flakey for my likings.  It's
very pleasing to see just how well it's come along since
then.  Many hip-hip-hoorays for sensible cookie controls. :)
<P>
<B>Shadow</b>&lt;RR&gt;
Shadow's decided to accept me as another rabbit, albeit a
rather large one.  He enjoys grooming my eyebrows,
eyelashes, and stubble.  I can't imagine anything much more
ticklish than having a rabbit groom one's eyelashes.
<P>
<B>Work/Consluting</b><BR>
Aaaaaaiiiiie!  It never rains, it pours.  I've been working
10-12 hour days for the last half-week, trying to deal with
quite a sizeable influx of work that's recently sprung up. 
If all goes as planned (ha!) then it should be finished by
spring, and I can take a nice long holiday again. That would
be nice.
<P>
<B>House</b><BR>
Roofing is done, restumping is done, we have hot water again
(ants nested in the gas booster and blocked up air-intakes,
starter-mechanisms and thermostats).  House is good.
<P>
<B>Homebrew</b><BR>
Our beer is drinkable, although <a href="/person/kevinl/">kevinl</a>'s
tastes better, but has less of a head.  The lemonade is
STILL fermenting, being slow because of the cold weather.

            <B>Rabbit</b><BR>
Shadow's delightful and friendly and still mostly litter
trained.  He enjoying playing with hair, ariel manuvers,
high-speed laps around difficult obsticles, and bananas.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Gmail has started at last. First invoice is away and coding
has begun.  Oddly enough, I still haven't managed to get out
of the requirements documentation.  I'm now in the process
of designing the stats reporting system (seem familiar?).
<P>
<B>Open Source</b><BR>
F::Q is way overdue for a new release, with plenty of new
code having been submitted a number of old bugs fixed up. 
After this release I'm looking at changing the way we
distribute the package and supporting files.  Most of the
"quotelets" can be distributed and upgraded seperately,
which will make bugfixing and maintainence easier (don't
need to release the entire package whenever the ASX change
their website).
<P>
Desperately want time to work on the work-tracking system
for <A HREF="http://www.obsidian.com.au/">Obsidian</a>.  I
estimate that I need about a 180 hour day to clear out my
backlog of higher-priority tasks.  Argh.
<P>
<B>Gardening</b><BR>
Have a 1/2 share mulcher with our <A
HREF="/person/kevinl">neighbours</a>. Have mulched stuff in
yard, but need to mulch more.  Now have more than 20 fruit
trees and vines, including:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>Lemon tree;
	<LI>Double-grafted orange tree;
	<LI>Lime tree;
	<LI>Mandarin tree;
	<LI>Tangello tree;
	<LI>Medlar tree;
	<LI>Vanilla persimonn tree; (gotta catch 'em all)
	<LI>Starfruit tree;
	<LI>2 fijoas (spel?  aka pineapple guava);
	<LI>1 yellow cherry guava;
	<LI>1 strawberry guava;
	<LI>Loquat tree;
	<LI>3 plum trees (including blood plum);
	<LI>2 apple trees;
	<LI>Apricot tree;
	<LI>Peach tree;
	<LI>Pomegranet tree;
	<LI>Red and Black passionfruit vines;
	<LI>Male and female kiwi fruit.
</ul>
<P>
I'm just looking forward to them all fruiting. :)
<P>
<B>Homebrew</b><BR>
It's all <a href="/person/benno/">benno</a>'s fault.  Have brewed up 20l
of "Coopers Sparkling", and have 20l of home-made lemonade
in the fermenter now.  That the beer was drinkable both warm
and flat has much to be said for its quality.
<P>
<B>Business</b><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.obsidian.com.au/">Obsidian</a> is happy
and still turning a profit.
