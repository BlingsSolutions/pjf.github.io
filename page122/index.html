            <B>Ian</b><BR>
Ian was very nice and drove me to a faraway place to get my
television repaired.  I'm glad that I don't drive, peak hour
traffic is awful, parking meters are expensive, and finding
parking spots is hard.  I'm very glad I have my $100 bicycle
which gets me home-to-work in 12 minutes with no pollution,
no expense, no parking hassles, and with a bit of healthy
exercise.  I'm still upset there aren't any more hills
between home and work, because I'm getting flabby with the
short trip.
<P>
Ian's also much become much better at rockclimbing than me,
so I'm incredibly jealous.
<P>
<B>Sofie</b><BR>
Sofie (Ian's partner) is going to come and work for
Schoolsnet in a couple of weeks.  This is good, because
Sofie appreciates good beer, whereas Ian and Benni don't.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Moving tomorrow, so I'm not expecting to get much done. 
Scotty tells me that I haven't been forgotten in bugland,
and that one day the promised land will come.  That's okay,
because I've got a bunch of bugs I'm going to be delegating
anyway.  :)
<P>
<B>Natedawg</b><BR>
Nate's practice at Half-Life is paying off.  He's become
incredibly good at Counter-Strike, probably because he plays
it very single night of the week.  He whipped our arses
hugely today, which was pretty humiliating.  To make things
worse, I'm going to be broken up from my old squad (Dancer
and Ben) as part of the move at work.
<P>
Nate also came climbing with us yesterday.  He looks pretty
spunky in my tight blue shorts.
<P>
<B>GnuCash</b><BR>
GnuCash is good.  Saved me money again by keeping a good
hold on my finances.  I'm most satisfied.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Benni has joined the Finance::Quote team and has offered to
do fun stuff with the web-page.  Thanks Benni!  (I suspect
the real reason is that he wants to write Advogato diaries
but feels he needs open-source experience to do so.)

            <B>Diplomacy</b><BR>
Both Schoolsnet games are up and running now, and it's been
lots of fun to watch.  I'm still surprised at how eager
everyone was to join and how quickly the games were started.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Moving to the new building at the end of the week. 
Hopefully we might have air-conditioners there, as I'm
finding the temperature in my office quite a bit high for my
liking.  It also looks like I'll get a beautiful view as
well.
<P>
It looks like I'll be sharing an office with <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/scottp>Scottp</a>, which
will make things interesting.  Not because there's anything
wrong with Scott, but because he's so valuable and in
demand, so I expect there'll be a lot of traffic through the
office.  I've also been known to generate a bit of traffic
with people reporting bugs, CVS issues, and other things.
<P>
Justin shall be posted at the door to try and stem the tide
of people.  He's rehearsing his line now -- "None shall
pass!".
<P>
<B>Gwen</b><BR>
Gwen's been a little angel.  I came home last night and
found that she had washed all the dishes.  Washing dishes is
my most hated chore, so I'm <I>very</i> thankful to Gwen for
this favour.  It looks like we'll be getting along well. 
She even said that she liked my cooking.
<P>
<B>Ian</b><BR>
Benni calculated how much Ian is paying for his new car on a
"per week" basis.  It's about twice what I pay in rent,
although I don't think he's planning to live in his car.
<P>
Ian's been claiming that the real reason he purchased the
car is that there are better seltbelts for me in the
back-seat.  (When there are five people in Ian's car, I
usually volunteer to sit in the middle at the back, between
any cute girls that might be in the same car.)  While I
think this is very kind of him, I'm surprised that he didn't
just give me $20,000 and keep the change for himself.  I'm
surprised at how generous he is.

            <B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Finance::Quote 0.18 is now out the door, and available and
advertised via CPAN, Freshmeat, Sourceforge, etc.  Now that
we have a reasonably stable library out the door we can
start working on new features.  (Like currency conversion or
a decent OO re-write.)
<P>
<B>Ian</b><BR>
I must apologise for saying that Ian purchased a ludicrously
expensive lockable sun-roof on wheels because his old car
lost that 'new' smell.  Apparently Ian's car was a couple of
years old when he purchased it, and he had been spraying it
with a can of "new car smell" to keep it smelling new.
<P>
I now know that Ian purchased a ludicrously expensive
lockable sun-roof on wheels because his can of "new car
smell" ran out.  *grin*
<P>
In Ian's favour, he did climb the Green 15 out at hardrock. 
I'm very impressed.
<P>
<B>Diplomacy</b><BR>
The first game starts shortly.  We almost have a full
compliment of players signed up.

            <B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Just received a letter informing me of a PHP version of
Finance::Quote's yahoo function that should be released in
the next couple of days.  This is great news, as I've had a
few requests for a PHP interface to Finance::Quote. I've
pointed the relevant people at each other and hopefully
they'll come to very happy arrangements.
<P>
I'm also thinking of writing a short guide on "How to submit
a patch for Finance::Quote", as it seems to be a
semi-regular requestion, and I most certainly do want the
patches.
<P>
I'm still going to try to release 0.18 today, although I'm
not certain of when I'll get the time to do it.
<P>
<B>Housemates</b><BR>
Jacinta's sister, Gwen, is moving in with us today.  She's
got herself a job in Melbourne and will be staying with us
for a while.  She's also applied for a job at Schoolsnet. 
Gwen's very nice, so I'm happy that she's moving in with us.

Wow!  13 people at work have told me they most certainly
want to play in a Diplomacy, and I'm sure that another one
will come out of the woodwork somewhere, giving us 14. 
That's enough for two standard games.  This is excellent, it
means I can play in one and GM the other.  I'm very much
looking forward to this.
<P>
Ross and Humpy also seem to be looking forward to the games
very much.  I think they'll show themselves to be excellent
players, which should make for an interesting game.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Back at work after a nice relaxing holiday.  I don't really
want to be back at work, I was just getting used to being on
holidays.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Intend to move version 0.18 out the door tomorrow.
<P>
<B>Ian</b><BR>
Ian's just spent some ludicrous amount of money on a new
car.  His old car worked fine, the only problem seems to
have been that it had lost its `new' smell.
