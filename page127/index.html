Looks like my playing with PAUSE this morning worked. 
Finance::Quote is now available on CPAN.

Well, I've gone from Apprentice, down to Observer, and now
I'm up to Journeyer.  At least I can post comments now, and
that makes me happy.  Thanks to everyone who's been taking
the time to certify me.
<P>
<B>Rockclimbing</b><BR>
Went rockclimbing today with Ian, Ben and Daniel.  It's good
to be well enough to go climbing again, as I haven't been
for some time.  I climbed a few new walls until my tummy
started hurting whenever I used upper-body strength.  I hope
this isn't the first sign of a herina (spel?).
<P>
Sofie (Ian's SO) has had her operation and is now allowed to
drink alochol again.  She's planning on getting pished next
week.  It should be fun.  She has a little jar of what the
doctors pulled from her when she was under the knife.  The
results look like little green teeth.  I'm sure this will be
a great conversation piece for her in the years to come.
<P>
We had mexican afterwards (the traditional food of
rockclimbers everywhere), and I brought some back for
Jacinta, who's caught my cold.  She seems a lot better now,
although I worry that she's read too many Larry Wall quotes
for her own good.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
None, because it's been a weekend.  However, my work account
does get my e-mail, and I don't seem to have been getting
many recently in my mailbox.  I <I>have</i> been getting
errors from fetchmail about POP3 failing.  I'm not happy. 
My outgoing e-mail seems to be fine.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote/GnuCash</b><BR>
<A HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/brentn>Brent</a>'s
patch for Finance::Quote has found it's way into GnuCash.  I
should probably e-mail him and let him know.
<P>
<A HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/mojotoad>Mojotoad</a>
has also released a perl module to fetch historical quotes
and looks like he's thinking of adding it to GnuCash.  This
is a <I>Good Thing</i>.
<P>
Played with <I>PAUSE</i> (Perl Author's Upload Server) a
little, although I'm still not used to it yet.  I'm sure
I'll manuver Finance::Quote onto CPAN soon.  :)

source and a new version released.  It can be found on the
<A

webpage</a> as version 0.17.
<P>
I'll integrate the changes into GnuCash shortly.
<P>
<B>Advogato</b><BR>
Advogato's trust metric seems a little weird.  Previously I
was certified as an Apprentice.  Now more people have
certified me (all at either Apprentice or Journeyer) but my
rating has dropped down to Observer.
<P>
I guess I'm going to have to read <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/trust-metric.html>the document
on trust metrics</a> to figure out why a single
Certification from <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/dancer>Dancer</a> can
make me an apprentice, but 5 Journeyer/Apprentice
certifications can drop me back to Observer...  It all seems
very bizzare.

            <B>Work</b><BR>
A Friday.  I figured everything would be pretty good.  Have
the morning meeting, drink a coffee, kick-back and leisurely
iron out a few stray bugs here and there.  Not the case.
<P>
This morning Dan called me in the middle of breakfast.  Told
me there was a problem.  Told me that bad things were
happening.  I told him that I'd be there shortly.
<P>
Cycled in, figured out the most likely cause of the problem
on the way in.  Came into work and discussed bugs with all. 
I suggested that one of the auxillary libraries which fixed
many of the bugs hadn't been upgraded.  We checked.  It had
been.  However, the main program itself wasn't upgraded to
the bugfixed version.  That would explain everything.
<P>
Made sure that all was upgraded properly, went to the
morning meeting, drank my coffee, kicked-back for some
bug-hunting and got emergency sticky-noted by Dan again. 
Apparently the bugs were back, and 10 times worse.
<P>
Went to lunch (being pretty hungry after being called away
from breakfast), came back, looked at errors.  No, there
were not 600 errors, there were only 8.  There were 592
instances of the server having a high-load and asking
clients to retry later.
<P>
Scott told Dan the good news (the mountain becomes a
molehill), and Dan looks like he's about to kiss one of us. 
I like Dan, but not that much.  Besides, he's getting
married in a couple of weeks.
<P>
Get back to my office, relax, tracked down the bug that was
causing the last 8 errors.  The bug was where we thought it
was all along, except that we'd always find other, bigger
bugs when we were looking for it.  This should be the final
battle of me verus The Obscure Bug, and with luck I should
win.
<P>
To make the day even more weird, Dan and the Systems team
have all gone off on `SysTrek' to discuss `Systems
Matters'.  This has pretty much killed our targets for
Half-Life tonight.
<P>
Rumour has it that performance reviews will be finished on
Monday.  I don't believe that will happen, but if they
aren't finished by next week we'll have to cancel Dan's
wedding.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Someone's grabbed it and worked on it and will be sending me
a patch shortly.  Mmmm....  Rapid development...
<P>
<B>Advogato</b><BR>
After re-reading the Advogato ratings I've re-certified
myself up to Journeyer.  Personally I feel I'm about
half-way between the levels at the moment, but as yet we
don't have a rating for that.  Mind you, the Meta article
seems to be suggesting we might have one soon.
