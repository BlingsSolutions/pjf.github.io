    <p>Every year I go travelling, and every year my bank suspends my credit card due to &#8220;suspicious behaviour&#8221;. Luckily, it&#8217;s easy to get the stops removed&#8230; too easy, in fact.</p>

<p>Today, when calling the bank to confirm that I had purchased a US phone service, I was asked only a single piece of identifying information, and that was my surname.&#160; The bank&#8217;s representative revealed—without my prompting—the last four digits of my credit card, and the full details of the transaction that was considered suspicious.</p>

<p>The thing is, if you&#8217;re the one making fraudulent transactions on a card, then you probably already know the cardholder&#8217;s surname, and you definitely know some recent suspicious transactions.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Better still, I assured my bank that I was travelling for the next few months, and even that the other cardholder was travelling as well.&#160; Still no verification except for my name.</p>

<p>To the bank&#8217;s credit, this is the first time I&#8217;ve encountered them being so lax with security. Every other time has involved me needing to provide a variety of information to verify my identity.&#160; If I were to guess a reason why things were different this time, it would be because I was calling at 7am on a Monday, and the vocal characteristics of the person I was speaking to suggested that he would really rather be in bed.</p>

<p>If you are a fraudster, then calling the client&#8217;s bank and trying to have the stops removed sounds like a low-risk, high-gain proposition; especially if you do it at crazy o&#8217;clock on a Monday morning.</p>

<p>In other news, I was reminded last week as to how easy it is to gain access to hotel rooms with swipe cards. After my card stopped working at a conference I was attending, all I needed to get a new card was my room number, and surname.&#160; For some of my friends that I spoke to, they didn&#8217;t even need to provide a surname.</p>

<p>Admittedly, one does need to hand over a hotel swipe card to give legitimacy to the &#8220;my card has stopped working trick&#8221;. If I didn&#8217;t have horrible jetlag, I probably would have tried the &#8221;I&#8217;ve locked my card in my room&#8221; line to see what response would have been given. I think there&#8217;s an excellent chance I would have been issued with a new card.</p>

<p>I have little doubt that a lot of this lax security is due to &#8221;<em>operational complacency</em>&#8221;. The vast majority of people who call reporting their card has been suspended, or their hotel key has stopped working, are legitimate: consequently, we&#8217;re trained into feeling that everything is working fine.&#160; It&#8217;s the same reason why we stop testing our backups, or checking to see if the GPS antenna in one&#8217;s cruise ship is actually connected¹.</p>

<p>Of course, the cure for operational complacency is well-known.&#160; You perform <em>vigilance tests</em>. In the same way a retailer can use <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_shopper'>mystery shoppers</a> to test if staff are asking customers if they&#8217;d like to supersize that meal, organisations can employ <em>mystery fraudsters</em> to make sure appropriate security procedures are being followed.</p>

<p>Even recording calls &#8220;for training and quality assurance purposes&#8221; gives one the ability to randomly audit interactions to ensure procedures are being followed.</p>

<p>Discovering my bank&#8217;s fraud department doesn&#8217;t record their calls? Priceless.</p>
