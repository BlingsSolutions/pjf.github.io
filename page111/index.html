Still have this weird desire to play really old PBMs that
don't seem to be around anymore.  I might well take up the
idea of re-coding the one I want to play most from memory in
C++, simply because I know just how long it's been since
I've really done anything in C++ and how rusty my skills in
that area have become.  Perl may be the swiss-army chainsaw
of the Internet, but that doesn't mean I can't get mental
RSI from using it.

1.04 (minor bugfixes) is out so that people will stop being
scared by a couple of oddities in the test suite.  Having
hit the SourceForge top fifty also makes me feel good.
<P>
Jon Orwant wants me to write another TPJ article.  Got to
get a draft to him by the end of this week.
<P>
<B>Lazy Days</b><BR>
Had Fri, Sat, Sun and Tues off work.  My goodness it's been
fabulous.  I've been spending my time cycling around what
must be some of the most beautiful parts of Melbourne,
learning how to do fun things with power tools at the new
house, and generally having a very relaxing time.  I really
don't want to go back to work -- I want to be a student
again with those endless summer holidays.
<P>
<B>Play By Mail</b><BR>
For some reason I've had an incredible urge to play a very
old PBM game I used to play back in my youth.  The game was
run by Peter Read of Dynamic Games, and I can't remember the
name, except that it involved robots and a hexagonal map and
bases and tunnels and a sensor net and stuff.  Different
robots had different powers -- some could build new sensors,
some were good at fighting, some were fast, some could build
tunnels, some could sense tunnels being built, and some very
special ones could even make use of Satellite Orbital Lasers
at blat things from a distance.
<P>
Unfortunately, after a fair bit of searching, I couldn't
find anything that looked like the game, nor do I know where
my old rule-booklets are.  I could try re-writing it based
upon my memories of it from about 10 years ago, and wait
until either (a) I get a cease-and-desist from some laywers,
in which
case I've found the original game, or (b) I finish it and go
looking for players.
<P>
I don't suppose anyone else can remember the game at all? 
If you do, please drop me a mail (pjf at CPANdotORG), I'd
very much appreciate hearing from you.

                <B>It's not just a house, it's an adventure</b><BR>
Got the keys to the house on Monday.  It rained all day,
which made me less enthusiastic about the whole deal of
cycling over to the real-estate agent and the house, but I
finally bit the bullet when I realised that the rain was
just not going to stop.
<P>
Yup, the house was still there and much as we left it. 
Spent about 90 minutes in the sogging rain doing things in
the garden, and decided that it was getting a bit dark and
started to head home.
<P>
Being wet and dark, and the roads a bit slippery, I decided
to take the Merri Creek trail -- a very scenic and relaxing
ride.  Lots of signs up saying "WARNING - Path subject to
flooding", but no actual signs of flood.  Sure, the water
was high, but it wasn't covering the path.
<P>
Nearing St Georges Road, which I would cut through to get
home, I passed a cyclist coming the other way.  She asked if
the path ahead of flooded.  I told her that no, it was fine,
and we went our seperate ways.  Once I got around the
corner, I realised that she was telling <I>me</i> that the
path was flooded, as the creek had broken its banks and
completely covered the path.
<P>
"Doesn't look very deep," I think to myself as I cycle into
the water.  Sure enough, it's only a couple of inches,
although it seems to go on for a long way.  "I'm surprised
that ducks can swim in water this shallow," I think to
myself just before I hit the dip in the path and find the
water level above the top of my wheels.
<P>
I had ducks swimming on either side of me as I continued to
cycle, with most of my bicycle underwater.  The ducks didn't
quite know what to think of me.  :)
<P>
The rest of the trip home went without mishap, although my
bike now has a "high water mark" which makes it quite
obvious how deeply it was underwater.
<P>
Haven't seen much rain today, so if all goes well I'll check
on the house tonight to make sure it's still standing.  Our
first few things (mainly gardening equipment) will be moved
this weekend.

Minor embarrasment as I discovered that I had to approve my
own posts to the finance-quote-news list.  The company I
work for changing its name as also meant that some of my own
mailing lists no longer recognise me.  Oops.
<P>
<B>House</b><BR>
Settlement is taking place right this very moment, and I
hope to pick up the keys in the next hour or so.  I was
hoping to lie in the sun at the new house, read a book, plan
the garden a bit, and plant some seeds so we'll have
something cropping for when we move in.  If I felt energetic
enough I was also planning on getting some materials to
build the chicken coop/run.
<P>
Unfortunately, after a beautiful weekend, today's turned out
to be very wet and rainy.  It was raining when I woke up at
8am this morning (yay for sleeping in), and it's still
raining now 5 hours later.  No sign of it stopping, either. 
As such, I think I'll have a very wet ride to pick up the
keys, and then spend time wishing I could lie in the sun and
read a book.
<P>
Over the next month we'll be moving things across to the new
house.  Passionfruit vines, rhubarb plants, many pots of
sunroot, seeds and tools, an avagato^W avacado tree and
eventually even furniture.  I've got enough friends and
family wanting to see the new place that I should be able to
get most of the fiddly things over before the big move. 
Somehow I don't think most removalists have much experience
with transporting an 18-month old passionfruit vine.  (Mind
you, neither do I.)
<P>
<B>Chickens</b><BR>
The council is sending me out a big set of local regulations
regarding the keeping of chooks.  Interestingly enough, the
maximum allowed without a permit is five, but I already
have six people expecting to have chickens named after them.
<P>
I guess I'll worry more about this as I get more chickens.
To start with I'm planning on getting two bantam australorp
hens, both named "Ian".
