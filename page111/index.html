Rolled in Finance::Quote 1.01 into the source-tree at last. 
GnuCash doesn't yet make use of the extra features yet (eg,
currency conversion or failover support), but it shouldn't
be too difficult to add.

            <B>House</b><BR>
Vendor isn't selling. At least we have a straight answer
now.  Guess I'll have to wait until Ian and Sofie find me
another house.  :)
<P>
<B>Blooper of the Week</b><BR>
It would appear that our phone system depends upon our DNS
functioning correctly.  Broken DNS = Broken phones.  Utterly
weird.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Volker Stuerzl has been kind enough to write and contribute
a Deutsche Bank Gruppe module for Finance::Quote.  We can
expect it to be released with version 1.02.
<P>
Unfortunately the ASX have re-butchered their site, and so
the ASX module is broken.  This sucks because the 1.01 test
suite takes FOREVER to run, because it results in timeouts
rather than unreachable host/refused connection.  Guess I'll
have to rewrite the ASX module properly so that it batches
requests.
<P>
I intend to roll F::Q 1.01 into GnuCash this weekend. 
Promise.

Let's see.  Negotiations have gone like this:
<UL>
<LI><B>9th August:</b> Yes, your offer will be accepted.  No
problems at all.  I'll go and talk to her tonight.
<LI><B>10th August:</b> The vendor has had a fight with her
brother.  She might not want to sell because she wants to
live there herself.  I'll find out for certain and let you
know tomorrow.
<LI><B>11th August:</b> I couldn't contact her, but I really
need to sit down and talk to her in person.  We'll
definitely know by tomorrow.
<LI><B>12th August:</b> The vendor's had some business
problems and needs to talk to her solicitors. She's meeting
with them on Monday.  We'll know for certain then.
<LI><B>13th August:</b><I>Sunday: Waiting for Monday</i>
<LI><B>14th August:</b>The solicitors are in court, so she
can't get in contact with them.  They're definitely not in
court tomorrow, so we'll absolutely know by then.  No
questions about it.
<LI><B>15th August:</b>The vendor hasn't talked to her
solicitors.  She's going to ring them from home tonight. 
We'll definitely know by tomorrow.
</ul>

<I>ARRRRRRRRGH!!!!!!!</i>
<P>
How hard is it supposed to be just to make an offer on a
damn house?  You'd think that if they went to all the
trouble of putting it on a market and dealing with real
estate agents that you'd actually want to sell!  *grumble*
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Have been elected as chief fire-warden for our floor.  I
think this means that if anyone dies in a fire, it's my
fault.  I'm honoured nonetheless.
<P>
It looks as if we're heading towards proactively fixing
problems before they become huge nasty bugs out in the real
world.  Of course, this might all change next week.
<P>
<B>Bike</b><BR>
Still sick.  Might get time to do something about it
tomorrow.  Definitely by ... Saturday.
<P>
<B>Open Source</b><BR>
Nothing which I've done, although there's been a bit of
interest in people writing new modules for <A
HREF="http://finance-quote.sourceforge.net/">Finance::Quote</a>,
which will be good if it happens.  (In this case the modules
are for UK mutual funds.)
<P>
<B>ADOM</b><BR>
Have dropped back a couple of versions because gamma 16pre-2
keeps segfaulting, and g15 segfaults even more.  I think it
would be nice if Thomas left debugging symbols in the binary
-- at least then I could use the magic of gdb to say which
function is causing the problems.

            <B>House (part 1)</b><BR>
Visited the Real Estate agents, wrote out the offer, signed
it, and handed them a cheque for a large sum of money. 
We're pretty sure we've got the house.  I'm very scared, but
also really looking forward to it all.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
My most recent paycheque is wrong.  It doesn't include
reimbusement for pizza.  (Yes, I legitimately claim pizza
purchased for the company every week.)
<P>
<B>Laserdiscs</b><BR>
My laserdiscs arrived, so I'll probably have a few friends
over shortly to help me watch them.  Unfortunately AnimEigo
screwed up my order, leaving out one LD and giving me to two
of another.  Hopefully they'll be able to resolve this in a
satisfactory manner.

            <B>House (part 2)</b><BR>
Everything's organised and then... the vendor doesn't want
to sell.  She's just had a falling out with her brother and
wants to stay in the house rather than sell it.  Real estate
agent is currently trying to convince her that after all
this hard work she really does want to sell, possibly with
an extended settlement period so she can't stay there in the
short-term.  (Extended settlement period is even better for
me, so I don't mind if that happens.)
<P>
<B>Fire training</b><BR>
Lots of fun.  Got to put out fires and go through
smoke-tunnels and play with fire extinguishers and watch
videos and wear hard-hats and special clothing.  Cool
stuff.  I want to do extra courses if possible.
