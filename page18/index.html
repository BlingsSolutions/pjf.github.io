is going to trump talk preparation for once.

        <div class="p-summary">
            
                <p><b>OSCON 2009 adventures</b><br>
I think that I've found a new term to describe myself. 
<i>Adventuretarian</i>.  I live off adventure.
<p>
<b>OSCON</b><br>
This was my second year at OSCON, and my first visit to San
Jose.  Unlike last year, where I was a self-described <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/toc.html?tag=oscon2008">OSCON
rockstar</a>, this year I was happy to take a more relaxed
approach.  I wasn't giving as many talks, the talks I gave
were all quite technical, and I didn't keynote.  However,
that doesn't mean I didn't have fun; far from it!
<p>
This OSCON I played around a bit with outfits.  I'd picked
up a pirate hat earlier in Portland, and used it in my
tutorial when talking about <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/tips/2008-05-23.html">PAR,
the Perl Archiver</a>.  The hat ended up being one of my
best fashion decisions ever, as it found its way into <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juliancash/3758284452/">photo</a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juliancash/3757488393/">shoots</a>,
restaurants, and social events.  In terms of getting
noticed, or being popular with small children, or having
random people say "Arrrr..." as they walk past, a pirate's
hat is awesome.
<p>
My other outfit was my Star Trek uniform, used for my talk
on <i>The Art of Klingon Programming</i>.  It's not
something I can ever imagining wearing for more than an hour
or two at a time, as it's hot, and doesn't breathe.  Of
course, it's fantastic when you want to hang out with the
cast of <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=581">Trek
in the Park</a>.
<p>
Talking of <i>The Art of Klingon Programming</i>, it looked
like it came across smashingly well, but I had forgotten to
remind the audience to <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009/public/schedule/detail/8165">rate
the talk</a> if they liked it.  So if you were there, and
you enjoyed the session, go rate it now. ;)
<p>
I went to less parties than last year, and so met fewer
people, but I was able to spend more time with people who I
really enjoy as a result.  One of the highlights was a beach
trip down to Santa Cruz and around to Half Moon Bay, with
some pretty spectacular beaches, cliffs, and even a light-house.
<p>
<b>San Francisco</b><br>
After the conference was a trip to San Francisco, staying
with <a href="http://www.juliancash.com/">Julian</a> (the
most amazing photographer ever), and Jackie (the most
amazing story-teller ever).  Julian and Jackie's house was a
hub of creativity and creative people.  If I hadn't been so
happily exhausted for OSCON I would have made more of it,
but as it was I feel I was almost bordering on impolite by
crashing and immersing myself in e-mail.
<p>
The next day involved a relocation to Skud's house, a
home-cooked meal (my first since Schwern's excellent cooking
in Portland), and discussions about San Francisco burrito
etiquette, gender issues, booth babes, Australian history,
pirates, musicals, and conferences.  Skud, Schwern, Jacinta,
myself, Valorie, and Andre, who I thought I had never met
went out for lunch and ice-cream.  Of course, in true small
world fashion, Andre was Australian, and knew me from
linux.conf.au.  He's now working for Pixar, which sounds
pretty sweet.
<p>
My last day in America involved Schwern, Jacinta, and myself
going of a tour of the more touristy parts of San Francisco.
 Crabs and clam chowder seem to be a big deal in these
parts, and I was given a "sample" of chocolate that I'm sure
provided me with my daily intake of sugar in a single bite.
 Unfortunately we didn't have enough time for a big
get-together of all the SF residents and visitors before I
had to fly out.  The flight home was good, with an
unexpected exit row seat providing lots of legroom.
<p>
<b>Home</b><br>
The only downer of the whole experience is that Jacinta had
managed to wrangle me a cool (first generation) Google
Android phone, which I discovered that I loved dearly, but
which seemed to have fallen from my pocket inside the taxi
home.  Attempts to recover it were without success, and
without having first recorded all the handset details I
can't remote-brick the phone, so it's unlikely I'll ever see
it again.  Jacinta's now given me <i>her</i> android phone,
and while I feel incredibly special and grateful, I'm
paranoid about losing it, too!
<p>
Today I'm preparing my new laptop, which is about twice as
awesome as my old one, comes with a three year worldwide
warranty, and costs only a third of the price.  Moore's Law
+ USA = Laptop win.  I'm also paying bills, sending out
invoices and faxes, paying super, catching up on tax, and
generally doing all the things that keep a small business
running.
<p>
Tonight I'm on a flight to Europe for YAPC::EU, which
possibly represents the first conference ever where I have
all my talks prepared and ready before the conference
starts.  I'll be back in Australia in a couple of weeks
time, no doubt exhausted from my trip and looking forward to
the next one.

                <p><b>Portland Adventures II</b><br>
Today is my last day in Portland, and wow, what an adventure it's been.  Friday was spent writing slides, relaxing in tea-houses (green mango bubble-tea with wifi rocks!), and a trip to <a href="http://portland.beerandblog.com/">Beer and Blog</a> at the Green Dragon.
<p>
Beer and Blog I was particularly pleased with on many different levels.  Ua had invited me to this fine establishment at last year's OSCON, and this represented me arriving, albeit a year late.  I had a chance to socialise with cool new people, although I didn't realise just <a href="http://twitter.com/WHIFFIES">how</a> <a href="http://fastwonderblog.com/about/">cool</a> some of them are until I did my research.
<p>
What made Beer and Blog really special was that during one of my conversations there was a comment that, "there's another Australian here, he's only just moved over".  That other Australian was <a href="http://twitter.com/McClure">Mike McClure</a>, with whom I went to University, but had not seen in about a decade!
<p>
Oh yes, Beer and Blog also had free beer.  That also made it special. ;)
<p>
That evening was I was given a tour of Portland by Schwern, Kate, Ua, and Nick.  That included beer, dinner, a walk along the river, and a trip to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voodoo_Doughnut">Voodoo Doughnuts</a>.  I'd been assured many times that my life would not be complete without having gone to Voodoo Doughnuts, and having been there, I can agree.
<p>
While I've been in Portland, <a href="http://chesnok.com/">Selena</a> has been a wonderful host, and I'd felt that I'd been a terrible guest.  Selena is a morning person, and I routinely came home late, slept in, and disappeared at odd times for ice-cream or doughnuts.  On Saturday morning, I was determined to buck this trend.

I made many great friends, and fell in love with the town and its people.  I was looking forward to returning to PDX every year, but unfortunately this year OSCON moved to San Jose.
<p>
Not to be denied the Portland experience by mere conference shifts, I arranged to arrive in America a week early, and re-visit PDX the week before OSCON.  I'm here right now with <a href="http://use.perl.org/~jarich/journal/">Jacinta</a>, and have had an incredibly social time with friends both old and new.
<p>
We've been staying with <a href="http://www.chesnok.com/">Selena</a> who has been nothing short of amazing.  Accommodation, network access, food, transport, good coffee, and most of all fantastic company have made me feel extremely privileged.  Selena knows <i>everyone</i>, and is incredibly popular, so we get invited to all the cool events too!  I've met more people in the last two days than I can possibly count.  Selena also has a beautiful house; and I'm currently sitting under a tree, next to a pond, with a fountain, fish, power, and wireless.  I could happily make this my new office.
<p>
I've had a chance to catch up with <a href="http://www.katealaurel.com/">Kate</a> and <a href="http://schwern.org/">Schwern</a>, who caught me on the night I landed in PDX for gelato and conversation.  Hanging with Kate and Schwern is like fractal socialising; I'll meet someone, discover we have common interests, they'll introduce me to someone else, and the process repeats.  It was only at 2am when I was talking to Kate's house-mate's boyfriend about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_the_gathering">Magic: The Gathering</a> that my body reminded me that I hadn't slept in a real bed for more than 48 hours, and that passing out in the middle of a conversation would probably be considered impolite.
<p>
Yesterday I went to the Portland Pirate Shop with the intention of picking up a puffy white shirt, and was informed that I had just missed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plunderathon">Plunderathon</a>, and that all the puffy shirts are gone, so I was doubly sad.  Next year I'll need to make sure to arrive in PDX much earlier, so I can participate in costumed piratical goodness.
<p>
Picking what to do in the evening was hard.  Portland seems to be the place where on a Thursday night one needs to choose between a mountain-biking festival, PostgreSQL user-group, Perl hackathon, and <a href="http://www.igniteportland.com/">Ignite Portland</a>.  It's a great place to be a geek.  ;)
<p>
In the evening I made it to Ignite, which I've decided that I <i>have</i> to speak at if I get the chance.  The audience is relaxed, friendly, looking to be entertained, and all have beer.  The talks were pretty good, too.  I even met one person who recognised me from my work on the Perl 5.8.9 release notes.
<p>
Afterwards I made it to the tail end of the hackathon, drank <a href="http://justatheory.com/">David's</a> beer at a pub that had a huge number of board-games, and retired back to Selena's with Schwern and Jacinta, where we talked late into the night about all sorts of Perl community ideas, including a cute little plan involving community achievement badges that I like to think of as "Perl Scouts". ;)
