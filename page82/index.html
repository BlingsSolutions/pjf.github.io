            <B>Fun, excitement, adventure!</b><BR>
Yes, I'm finally doing my tax.  I get to fill out the main section, a supplimentary section, and a supplimental to the supplimentary section.  Oh yes, I also get a number of tax rulings to peruse on various topics.  Hurrah.
<P>
Despite this, the whole thing looks surprisingly straightforward, probably because I have GnuCash measuring all the relevant details and I just need to copy out the totals of the various ledgers.
<p>
From my current estimates, I'll get a return of about $500.  No big deal there, except that it means that I've overpaid my tax <i>again</i>.  This is a good thing, because it means the tax office judges me a responsible taxpayer, and consequently they're fine with me paying tax when I see fit, rather than having to pay a portion on my income every quarter; provided that the tax gets paid, of course.
<p>
The end result of this is that I get to keep the rather sizeable sum that would normally go to the tax department, and float it in an account instead where it can earn interest.  Then at the end of the financial year, I give the tax office, and pay extra tax on the interest from the float.  Good for me, good for the tax office.
<p>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Insane.  Not only are work and the wedding competing for time, but we're trying to move the business into a stage where it can be managed by others while Jacinta and myself are absent on honeymoon.  Ian's agreed to cover most of the fire-fighting and sysadmin side of things, and Lizy will be handling course bookings and administration.
<P>
<B>Perl</b><BR>
Perl 5.8.1 has just been released.  This is actually a special release for me, since there's a little bit of me in the newer NEXT module that comes with it.

            <B>Hardware</b><BR>
Hardware sucks.   Got some spangly new graphics card that's supposed to run like the wind, but it doesn't want to work with the old mobo.  Fine, muck around with hardware, put it into the new mobo (which will eventually go into one of our servers) and it works.  Good.  It's got a DVI output, and we have LCD screens.  Plug the two together, and I find a flickering bunch of crud with edge effects everywhere.  About to try it using the standard VGA connectors, but I thought DVI was supposed to give you a clearer picture, not a cruddier one.
<p>
<B>Dance Games</b><BR>
Are lots of fun, and make a surprisingly good workout.
<p>
<B>Wedding</b><BR>
Is still happening, and requires far too much organisation.
<p>
<B>Staff</b><BR>
Usually I try to avoid poaching from my clients, as taking their good staff members doesn't always make them happy.  However I have one client who's offered to introduce me to some of their eligible and clueful staff members for poaching, no doubt to free up more of my own time to work for them.  I really am honoured, and think that it's a very strange world that we work in.
<p>
<B>Upstream proxies</b><BR>
Are running dead-slow tonight.  Thank-goodness I can turn them off.

            <B>Dance Games</b><BR>
Managed to find an on-line retailer with clues and a copy of the required game.  Hurrah.
<p>
<B>Accountancy</b><BR>
We seem to be missing a statement from the bank.  Either we received it and it's been mis-filed, it was never sent in the first place, or it was lost/stolen in transit.  Given that Jacinta and myself keep separate copies of this particular bank's statements, it looks like it's lost.  That worries me, but given that I've seen our post arrive in the entirely wrong suburb before, or us receive mail for occupants in a different house in a different street, it's not entirely surprising.
<p>
It is, however, incredibly bothersome.  I can't reconcile that account until the missing statement arrives.
<p>
<B>Employees</b><BR>
Lizy has started working with <a href="http://perltraining.com.au">Perl Training Australia</a>.  So far she's shown herself to be extremely organised, skilled, and is showing plenty of initiative.  The only problem is that I only have her on a part-time basis.
<p>
<B>Tax</b><BR>
Yup, I need to complete my tax.  Even with highly detailed financial records it's still a complete bore.
<p>
<B>Wedding</b><BR>
Is happening very soon now.  Organisation is huge.  I'm surprised the wedding industry does't put together package deals.  Buy a reception for 100 people, honeymoon to one of these destinations, photos, flowers, wedding location, cars,  invitations, celebrant, gift registry, dresses and suits, and a pair of fashionable wedding rings for only $xx,xxx.  Finance to approved customers, early-bird discounts available, conditions apply.
<P>
I guess everyone wants their wedding to be unique and special, or maybe I'm just missing something.

            <B>Appreciation from clients</b><BR>
I had the entire support team from one of my clients spend considerable time telling me how much they appreciated my work, and how it would save them incredible amounts of pain and end-user headaches.  I was honoured, and quite speechless.
<p>
<B>David's leaving</b><BR>
One of my very good friends is joining the Army, and is likely to be posted to some far-away place by the end of this week.  He'll be sorely missed, although we all hope that he'll be able to make it back for the wedding, as he has a spot on the bridal party to fill.
<P>
<B>Cheesy Dance games and mats</b><BR>
We're now the proud owners of two cheap playstation dance mats.  They're just like regular controllers, only rolled out into large plastic sheets you can dance around on, and with all the controls in different locations.  Getting the mats was easy, they'll available everywhere, although prices seem to range from AUD $30 to AUD $300, depending upon quality and construction.
<p>
We thought it would be easy to pick up a cheesy game like <a href="http://gamenation.com.au/product/?action=view&id=941">Dance Stage Konamix</a>, which is designed to work really well with the mats.  In fact, it's proving to be an extremely difficult task.  The only place I can find that seems to have it has a broken registration process, broken ordering form, broken e-mail, and no contact details.  Despite that, the site appears to be regularly updated and maintained.  I figure that nobody's been able to actually contact them to tell them what's broken.
<p>
We ended up playing Gran Turismo and Pocket Fighter on the mats, both of which were interesting experiences.  We also played a little Bust'a'groove, which is definitely <i>not</i> designed to be played on a mat.  Hopefully we'll have the appropriate game(s) by the end of this week, before David dissapears.
