            <p><b>I'm going to be a TV host</b><br>
I was recently contacted by an associate who asked if I'd be interested in appearing as a guest on a new TV show pilot; needless to say, I agreed.  Yesterday I arrived for the recording.
<p>
"How are you feeling?" I was asked.<br>
"Nervous," I admitted.<br>
"Well, you'll be more nervous in a moment."<br>
"Really?  Why is that?"<br>
"Well, instead of having you as a guest, we were wondering if you'd like to be a <i>TV host</i>.  For the <i>whole season</i>."
<p>
Apparently being a TV host is a lot less work than I would have expected, because in a 30 minute episode there's only 24 real minutes of show (the rest are taken up with credits, "words on our sponsors", etc), and after segments and specials and reviews and the like, I'll only be on air for maybe 12 minutes in total.  In an eight hour day of recording it's reasonable that we'll get at least 36 minutes worth of decent footage, so we can potentially knock over half-a-season in a weekend.  Of course, that's all assuming that as a host all I really need to do is look good in front of the camera.
<p>
The show looks like it will be called "The Geek Show", will run on channel 31, and start showing in September.  All this is still a little provisional, since there's quite a few hurdles to jump before then, but it's still very exciting!
<p>
Flame, who some of my readers may know from his OSDC presentations, is the main driving force and creative talent behind the show.  And this isn't the only FOSS-friendly, geeky TV show that I hear is in the works.  However I don't know if I can talk about the others.
<p>
The ironic part of all this is that my channel 31 reception is <i>awful</i>, so I'll probably have to go visit friends to watch the show each week.  ;)

            <p><b>Perl Tip: Building Perl Executables with PAR</b><br>
I think that PAR, the Perl Archiver, is just fantastic.  Rather than having to worry about dependencies, and getting a whole raft of modules installed onto my target system, I can just drop them all into a Perl Archive and be done with it.  Best of all, using the <tt>pp</tt> command, I can build an executable that will run even without perl installed at all!
<p>
As such, it's no surprise that our latest <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Tip</a> from <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a> is on <b><a href="http://perltraining.com.au/tips/2008-05-23.html">Building Perl Executables with PAR</a></b>.

For anyone wondering, yes, it's written in Perl.  It uses PAR/PP to package the whole thing up into a single Windows executable.  Yes, it plays MineSweeper acceptably well, thanks to Audrey Tang showing me the cheat codes at OSDC a few years back. ;)

            <p><b>Rate a CPAN module today!</b><br>
One of the tough challenges facing someone new to Perl, or even someone who has been using it for years, is navigating the huge number of modules available via <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN)</a>.  CPAN is <i>very</i> comprehensive, with the little stats in the corner listing 6,500+ authors, 15,000+ distributions, and 55,000+ modules.  That's a <i>lot</i> of code.
<p>
Unfortunately, being faced with so many options can be daunting.  The <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">search.cpan.org</a> interface <i>tries</i> to show the most relevant results first, and seems to pay a good amount of attention to <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/">CPAN Ratings</a>, and rightly so.  In order for a module to be rated, someone has to get themselves a <a href="https://www.bitcard.org/">bitcard account</a> (usually meaning they're a CPAN author themselves), use the module, and have the time and passion to write a review.  This means that when such reviews do come in, they're highly relevant.
<p>
Unfortunately, not very many modules have been given reviews, and often those reviews are given to modules that already have a substantial number already, like <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/dist/DBI">DBI</a>.  Yet it's the modules that <i>don't</i> occur commonly in literature that need the reviews the most.
<p>
So, dear reader, today I wish to give you a quest.  Go to <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/">CPAN Ratings</a>, search for a module you use, and if it doesn't have a review, write one.  That's it, just a single review.  I don't care if you love the module or hate it, just let the world know how you feel.  It can be a single sentence if you like. Heck, you can even critique <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~pjf/?R=D">one of my modules</a> if you want.  Just write a review.
<p>
If you don't know where to start, go to a piece of code you've worked on, or the tests for that code, and just look at the <tt>use</tt> lines.  Trust me, you'll find something you care about.  It may even be something that was so simple and easy to use that you had forgotten all about it.
<p>
Finally, if you're itching to start a new project, and need an idea, turn <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/">CPAN Ratings</a> into a game, the same way it was done with the <a href="http://cpants.perl.org/index.html">CPAN Testing Service</a> and <a href="http://cpants.perl.org/kwalitee.html">Kwalitee</a>, or <a href="http://perlmonks.org/">PerlMonks</a> and their <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=5938">XP system</a>.  New reviews on a module give you +2 points, reviews on a module that already has reviews give you +1 point, each person who found your review useful gives you +1 point, and each person who didn't find your review useful gives you -1 point.

            <p><b><a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?IPC::System::Simple">IPC::System::Simple</a>
released - Cross-platform, multi-arg backticks</b><br>
One of my greatest itches with Perl is the difficultly in
doing things correctly with the <tt>system()</tt> command,
which allows one to run a process and wait for it to finish,
and backticks (aka <tt>qx()</tt>), which allows one to run a
process and capture its output.
<p>
It's not that these commands are hard to use. 
<tt>system("mount /dev/backup")</tt> and I've got my backup
media mounted.  <tt>my $config = qx(ipconfig)</tt> and I've
got my Windows IP configuration.  They're dead easy to use,
they're just a pain to tell if they <i>worked</i>.
<p>
After running, these commands set a special variable named
<tt>$?</tt>, or <tt>$CHILD_ERROR</tt> if you've told perl to
<tt>use English</tt>.  This variable is designed to be
"friendly" to "C programmers", who are familiar with the
return value of the <tt>wait()</tt> system call.  But who on
earth <i>wants</i> to be familiar with the return value of
<tt>wait()</tt>?  After teaching <i>thousands</i> of people
Perl over the last seven years, I've only had <i>two</i>
people admit to know what the <tt>wait()</tt> return value
looks like, and both of them needed therapy afterwards. 
It's a packed bit-string, and is grossly unfriendly for
anyone to use in any language.
<p>
So, the usual state of affairs for many developers is they
go through their day using <tt>system()</tt> and backticks
and completely ignoring <tt>$?</tt>, because it's too hard.
 Then one day a disaster happens where they discover that
all their backups are empty, or all their files are
corrupted, or all their furniture has been repossessed,
because their calls to <tt>system()</tt> have been failing
for years, but nobody noticed because <tt>$?</tt> was too
ugly to contemplate.
<p>
Those developers who have been through this process, or seen
other people's lives ruined usually try to take a little
more care.  They recall that <tt>$?</tt> will be exactly
zero if the process ran to completion and returned a zero
exit status, which usually indicates success.  Their code
becomes littered with statements like <tt>$? and die $?</tt>
or <tt>system(...) and die $?</tt>.  That makes them feel
warm and fuzzy until they discover it doesn't work.  Their
command may legitimately return a range of statuses to
indicate success, and a whole bunch of things to indicate
failure.  Worse still, printing the contents of <tt>$?</tt>
as an error message is worse than useless.  Nobody
understands what the hell it means; if you did, you wouldn't
be printing it.
<p>
The end result of all this is that Perl sucks at something
it's <i>supposed</i> to be good at; namely firing off system
commands and being awesome for system administrators.  It is
this problem that <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?IPC::System::Simple">IPC::System::Simple</a>
solves.
<p>
Put simply, if you're using <tt>IPC::System::Simple</tt>,
you can replace all your calls to <tt>system()</tt> with
<tt>run()</tt>, and all your calls to backticks with
<tt>capture()</tt>, and it will all work the same way,
except that you'll get incredibly useful messages on error.
 Got a funny exit status?  It'll tell you what it is, and
the command that caused it.  Killed by a signal?  You'll get
not just the number, but its <i>name</i>, as well a whether
it dumped core.  Passed in tainted data?  You'll get told
what was tainted.  And it gets better.
<p>
Let's say that you're using <a href="http://www.samba.org/rsync/">rsync</a> to backup your
files from an active filesystem.  It exits with 0 for good,
and 24 for "files went missing".  On an active filesystem,
files disappearing can be considered normal, so we'd like
both of these to be considered 'fine'.  Anything else, we'd
like to get told.  Can we do this with
<tt>IPC::System::Simple</tt>?  We sure can!  Just provide
the list of acceptable exit statuses as the first argument:
<blockquote><tt>run( [0,24], "rsync ....")</tt></blockquote>
<p>
<tt>IPC::System::Simple</tt>'s <tt>run</tt> command also
works the way that <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?perlsec">the Perl
security pages</a> say that <tt>system()</tt> should run. 
That is, when called with multiple arguments, it bypasses
the shell.  Perl's regular <tt>system()</tt> when called
with multiple arguments will go and use the shell
<i>anyway</i> when on a Windows system, which is bad if you
were trying to avoid shell meta-characters.
<p>
You can get the same shell-bypassing behaviour with
<tt>capture()</tt>; just pass it in multiple arguments and
you're done.  This even works under Windows, which normally
doesn't even support shell-bypassing pipes, let alone
checking your command's return values and formatting your
errors afterwards.  You even get the full 16-bit Windows
exit value made available to you, which is something
<tt>$?</tt> and its dark terrors will never give you.
<p>
Best of all, installing <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?IPC::System::Simple">IPC::System::Simple</a>
is a breeze.  It's pure perl, with <i>no</i> dependencies on
non-core modules.  Even if you have no other way of
installing modules, you can just copy the <tt>.pm</tt> file
into an appropriate directory and you're done.
<p>
Don't put up with the tragedies and uncertain futures that
<tt>system()</tt> and backticks can bring.  Use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?IPC::System::Simple">IPC::System::Simple</a>
and make handling your system interactions correctly a
painless experience.
