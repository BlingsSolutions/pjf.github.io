It's with great delight that myself and {%t nayafia %} are hosting Contribute at OSCON this year.

<!--more-->

Inspired by some of the amazing hacker lounges held at other conferences, we're an open space
that's dedicated to the advancement of Free and Open Source software and related communities.
While we have scheduled sessions for specific projects, we we're a space for any and all
projects that need a space for coding, community, planning, meetings, or just plain getting together.

We also have dedicated hosts so if you have questions about making your first contributions, want
to share skills, or just need someone to bring you coffee.

You can learn more about contribute on the [official OSCON schedule page](http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/open-source-us/public/schedule/detail/51586).
