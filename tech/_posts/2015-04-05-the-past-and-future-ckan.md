title: The Past and Future CKAN

It's been almost five months since the first version of the Comprehensive
Kerbal Archive Network (CKAN) was released. What started as a desire to
make it easier to install and manage Kerbal mods has now turned into a
system that's used by tens of thousands of users, along with hundreds
of contributors to our metadata and code. The CKAN has been a *huge*
success.

Last month, I posted saying that we were 
[looking for an infrastructure sponsor](http://pjf.id.au/tech/2015/03/12/ckan-infrastructure-sponsor-needed.html)
to help us with our growing needs, and I'm delighted to say that
search has been successful. We're very grateful to 
[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) for their ongoing support.
With the help of AWS, we're not only ensuring that mods are indexed
quickly and our code is continuously tested, but we're also mirroring
thousands of past and present mod releases. We're looking forward to
future CKAN clients being faster and more reliable than ever before.

Our biggest challenges at the moment are not technical, but instead
time pressures faced by many of our key contributors. All the CKAN
developers work on the project in their spare time, and we have some
outstandingly talented people. However that means they're
also starting companies, running successful businesses, jumping out
of airplanes, or having rich and varied lives that compete for their
time.

In order to ensure the continued development and support of the CKAN,
I'd like to move it out of the things I do when I have spare time,
and instead into the things I do as part of my job, with regular code
sprints, scheduled work days, progress reports, and accountability.

I run my own software consultancy, so having the CKAN as part of my
job is entirely possible, but it means turning down other projects to
make time for it. To see if this is possible, I've created a
[patreon page](https://patreon.com/pjf0) to support my CKAN
development efforts. I've already got co-working space and a huge
amount of coffee booked for the 12th April, so if we hit our first
funding milestone by that time, it will be the first CKAN sprint.

Regardless of whether we make the funding goals or not, I still intend
to work on the CKAN during my spare time as I always have. However if
successful I'm looking forward to being able to devote more and
regular hours to CKAN development and support.

For everyone who has contributed to the project, *thank you* for
helping make it the incredible success that it is today. It's been
a pleasure working with you, and I look forward to doing even more of
the same in the future.

If you'd like to support me in developing the CKAN, or simply learn
more about my plans, please visit my

Many thanks,

(CKAN project founder)
