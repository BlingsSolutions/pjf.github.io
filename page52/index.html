                <p><b>End of financial year</b><br/>
It's the end of financial year, and everyone and everything is just a little more hectic because of it.  I have a ton of deadlines: negotiations with our bank, taxation matters, a stupidly big pile of paperwork, and a number of conference and magazine-article related matters.
<p>
However my real task for the day is clearing my desk, and making sure that there isn't anything that we really want to take advantage of in the 2004-05 financial year.  Any spare time will be spent catching up on accounting and tax matters.
<p>
The good news is that despite the busy time was year, I was still able to go out to dinner last night with about a dozen very good friends, and I was still able to sleep until the gloriously late time of 10am.  One of the distinct advantages of running one's own business is flexibility of hours.
<p>
On the matter of running a business, I'll be presenting a short yet amusing talk on starting a business at the <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/osdclub/">Open Source Developers Club</a> on the 13th July, 2005.  This will be a sneak-preview of my paper and presentation for the <a href="http://www.sage-au.org.au/conf/sage-au2005/">Australian System Administrators Conference</a> in Perth later this year.

I was shocked to read <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=24171">this article</a>.  Nigel McFarlane was an active and vibrant member of the Australian open source community.  Our first real encounter with Nigel was when he called wanting to interview Jacinta for a newspaper feature-article on Melbourne's successful open source businesses.  The interview resulted in a discussion of <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a> in one of Australia's most widely-read newspapers.  After that it seemed that I was bumping into Nigel everywhere &mdash; industry functions, user groups, conferences, and an almost endless number of mailing lists.
<p>
Nigel was an author of numerous books, a strong supporter and active member of the Mozilla/Firefox project, a regular speaker at conferences, and even drew crowds for 2600 meetings.
<p>
Nigel's insight, talent, and enthusiasm will be sorely missed.

                <p><b>World of Warcraft EULA</b><br/>
I don't try to hide the fact that I'm a gamer.  I love games.  Card games, board games, computer games, strategy games, role-playing games, on-line games.  I love them all.  I helped start an AD&amp;D club in grade 4 in <i>primary school</i>.   I wrote a printer-driver as an English assignment in high-school to print Tolkien's Dwarven runes on a Commodore-64 printer.  I'm a gamer, through-and-through.
<p>
The gamers of the world are blessed through modern games technology.  Present-day computers are capable of producing mouth-wateringly good graphics and sound, and with the rise of the Internet, huge and detailed multi-player games have become available.  The early forms of these were the MUDs &mdash; Multi User Dungeons/Domains/Dimensions, and were text-based.  The newer games games are often referred to as MMORPGs &mdash; Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games, and are immersive experiences.
<p>
I've played a number of MMORPGs in my time.  There's currently a "second generation" of MMORPGs, including Everquest II, Star Wars Galaxies, and World of Warcraft, that build significantly upon what was learnt from older, "first generation" MMORPGs like EverQuest.  The second generations MMORPGs are undergoing plenty of growth, and with good reason.
<p>
I have a number of friends who play <i>World of Warcraft</i> (WoW), one of the second-generation MMORPGs made by Blizzard Entertainmentww.  WoW have had the foresight to include a free "guest pass" with boxed copies of the game. This allows an owner of the game to give their friend a 10-day free trial.  I recently had one of these handed to me.
<p>
I had a hard time getting through the registration process.  In order to participate in the "free trial" one needs to provide name, address, telephone number, and credit card details.  It looks like Blizzard isn't interested in anyone participating unless they can provide significant proof they have the capability to go and purchase a boxed-set of the game, and then pay an ongoing subscription fee.
<p>
After a day or two I finally agreed to provide Blizzard with what I thought was an excessive amount of registration information.  I'm eager to play with new toys, and I have plenty of friends telling me how much they enjoy the game.  Having completed the registration, the game starts, and immediately starts to download a patch.  I was expecting this, MMORPGs are regularly patched to add new features.
<p>
Finally, the patch installs, and an End User License Agreement (EULA) is displayed; and then a second one.  Included in the patch is an <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/legal/termsofuse.html">updated EULA</a>, and it makes a standard MMORPG license look like a walk in the park.  In particular, it includes the following:

        <div class="p-summary">
            
                <p><b>Liver function tests</b><br/>
Yesterday my doctor told me that I have a lifelong, incurable disease, and I was overjoyed by the result.  It was the best possible news.
<p>
It all started about six weeks ago, when I had a blood-test taken by the doctor.  I was feeling great, and I'm sure most people in my situation would have been out doing something enjoyable, rather than being prodded with a needle in a doctor's surgery.  However, I believe in catching problems well before they start.  A little blood-work now and again is a great way to spot issues before they turn into more serious problems.
<p>
In any case, I hadn't expected my blood tests to show anything abnormal, so I was rather surprised when my results came back with elevated liver enzyme levels (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase">ALT</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_phosphatase">ALP</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GGT">GGT</a>).  This in itself was no great cause for alarm; I was showing no other signs or symptoms of ill-health, and there are many acute reasons why they could be elevated.
<p>
A discussion with the doctor convinced me to give up alcohol for the next month, just to be on the safe side, at which point a second blood-test would be taken.  So I went around my business pretty much as normal, although with a few regrets that I couldn't enjoy the occasional beer after work.
<p>
My second blood test results were more interesting, and it was ironic that due to an IT problem the surgery only had a partial copy of the results.  However from that partial transcript it was clear that my enzyme levels were still elevated, and that I didn't have any of the nastier forms of infectious hepatitis.  However we were at a loss as to why my levels were still high.
<p>
The doctor scheduled me for a full abdominal ultrasound.  The ultrasound machine was one of the coolest toys I had seen in a long time.  A small amount of gel, a hand-held sensor, and one can take incredibly detailed images of inside a patient.  I spent half the examination gawking at the machine and asking how it worked, as well as discussing how the organs are imaged and measured. 
<p>
The examining doctor did a very thorough job, with images taken of my spleen, kidneys, gall-bladder, aorta, and of course my liver.   Lots and lots of liver images.  The result was that every single organ looked completely normal in size, shape, and texture.  No signs of disease, no signs of inflammation.
<p>
Back to the doctor with my ultrasound results, and what I was expecting to be a perplexing situation for the both of us.  However this time my doctor had the full results in front of her, and discovered that I tested positive for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytomegalovirus">Cytomegalovirus</a>, or CMV.
<p>
A person living in the USA has between a 50 and 85 percent change of contracting CMV by the age of 40, and I imagine the conditions in Australia are much the same.  The virus remains dormant for most of its life, but will occasionally flare up causing flu-like symptoms, particularly when the patient's immune system is weakened.  When it does so, it also causes mild, reversible hepatitis.  It has no long-term health consequences, and is not considered a serious disease.
<p>
Now everything makes sense.  I had recently been showing flu-like symptoms near the time of my blood tests, and the elevated enzyme levels without apparent inflammation or damage to the liver is a classic sign of CMV.  I'm getting some more bloodwork done to make sure, and should have a conclusive result by next week.
<p>
What's interesting about this whole affair is that I've known that I've had CMV for years.  I'm a regular blood donor, and CMV is one of the routine tests performed on blood donors.  When I showed up positive many years ago I had queried the blood bank about it, and they simply described it as "a type of flu, not something to be concerned about".
<p>
If my doctor and the blood bank had actually compared notes, then my CMV status would have been already known, and a test for activated CMV could have been performed immediately, potentially saving me a rather uneasy period where I knew there was some "mystery disease" that was causing problems with my liver.  Still, I'm very glad that it looks like I'll be given a clean bill of health.
