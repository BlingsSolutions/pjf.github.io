                <B>Banking</b><BR>
Banks can really be a pain sometimes.  Personally, my banking matters are pretty simple.  There's a home loan offset account, which acts in many ways like a personal account, and there's a credit card (paid off in full each month), which makes every day purchases considerably easier.
<p>
Everything works pretty well, until you try to bank a foreign cheque.  The home loan just plain doesn't do foreign currency, at least they're honest about it.  The credit card (with a different financial institution) is happy about doing foreign currency, but their banking system doesn't allow them to put a 28 day hold on the funds from the foreign cheque -- something about bad software on their behalf.
<p>
As such, trying to deposit a foreign cheque to the credit card makes the bank uneasy -- I might spend those funds before the cheque has cleared, and that would be <i>terrible</i>.  I should note at this point that said foreign cheque is a bank cheque, not a personal cheque, and is covered in holograms and watermarks.  I usually point this out to the bank, along with the facts that I pay off the card every month, I never go near the credit limit, and I've never been refused for the dozen or so foreign cheques that I've banked previously.
<p>
Usually, after much talk up and down the chain of command, the cheque is finally deposited.  However sometimes it's refused.
<p>
Luckily for me, the following proceedure has always worked without fail:
<pre>
foreach bank
    foreach teller
        say "Hi, I'd like to deposit a foreign cheque to
             my credit card";
</pre>
Eventually, I'll hit someone who doesn't know there's supposed to be 15 minutes of ceremonial grieving by the bank before refusing, or just flat out doesn't care.  Usually I succeed after 1.2 branches.
<p>
The whole thing <i>does</i> get rather tiresome, and as the whole matter appears to be entirely discretional, is highly dependant upon branch/staff/managers.
<p>
I'm investigating alternative arrangements, the most useful of which would be an account in US dollars.
<p>
<b>Broody chook</b><br>
Broody chook is <i>still</i> broody.  It's been something like four weeks now.  If we weren't able to steal eggs from her each evening, she'd be sitting on a mound of about <i>eighty</i> eggs by now, trying to make them hatch.  Given that we don't have a rooster (and so the eggs aren't fertile), the whole thing is starting to get a little silly.  I'm even considering going and buying her some day-old chicks to break her out of her broodyness.
<p>
She stayed off the nest long enough today (to eat and dust bathe) that I could change the straw in the nesting area.  She had a huge sook about me doing that.

Of course!  Why didn't I think of it?  The trick was to power cycle the machine another couple of times after the "successful installation".
<p>
I'm so glad I usually work with an OS that doesn't require five reboots to install a new mouse (that uses the same mouse protocol as the old mouse).

                <B>Mouse drivers (rant)</b><BR>
My old scummy $10 mouse developed a problem with one of the buttons, and so a very nice friend donated me his old Microsoft Intellimouse (he's got some swish optical wireless thing now).  I plugged the mouse in and started using it under Linux without thinking much more about it.  However, on the rare occasions that I do use Windows, I noticed that the mouse wheel didn't work.  Today I thought I'd fix that.
<p>
It appears that while my $10 trash mouse could fit its driver on a floppy disk, to get a Microsoft Intellimouse to run you either need the CD that comes with it, or a 10Mb download from Microsoft.  10Mb seemed to be a lot for a mouse-driver, but it rapidly became apparant that it included all their mouse drivers, plus pictures of all the mice, plus advertising materials, a swag of different EULAs, and a few system files.
<p>
Installing the software required two reboots of the machine.  At the end, there's a walk-through showcase explaning how great your nice mouse is, filled with more pictures.  It even shows you a picture of the mouse it's installed thd drivers for so you can compare it to the one sitting under your hand.  Yup, that looks like my mouse.
<p>
Unfortunately, after all that, the wheel <i>still</i> doesn't work.  The Microsoft Mouse Troubleshooting Page concludes that my PS/2 port is incompatible with the mouse's scroll function.  Impressive that Linux is able to use the wheel without issue, given my hardware is supposedly broken.
<p>
The new drivers seem to be putting the mouse into a state where the wheel functions are disabled.  How do I know?  Because if I reboot into Linux from Windows without power-cycling the machine, the mouse shows all the symptoms of an incorrect driver (pointer jumps erratically and clicks erratically).
<p>
I suspect I'm going to see if there's a "generic ImPS/2 windows driver" out there, and use that rather than the 10Mb bundle of Microsoft stuff.

                <B>Petting zoo</b><BR>
We've been discovered by some of the local school-children, and during the school holidays became something of a petting zoo.  Chickens apparently have extra cool value with primary school kids.
<p>
"I'm not going to tell <i>anyone</i> about this place, it's just too cool!" was remarked by one younger of the two children who discovered our property.  Within a week she "hadn't told" another half dozen children or so.
<p>
The girls want to play with power-tools, and paint the house, of course.
<p>
<b>Tax</b><br>
Tax returns suck.  Most people just need to put in their income, how much tax was taken out, write $300 in the box marked "other business expenses", and wait for their cheque.  When you're actually running a business (especially if you start it part-way through the financial year), things become much more difficult.
<p>
What makes it even more fun is that in my haste last year I claimed a bunch of small purchases as regular purchases, not asset purchaes.  I believe due to their low cost and nature this is fine.  However I can depreciate an asset over multiple years, and I'm expecting to have a significantly higher income over this year (and the years to come) compared to last year, so depreciating assets are good, so I don't want these as expenses anymore.  That stick of RAM is an asset now (or an improvement to an asset).
<p>
What this means in the end is a bunch of paperwork.  Hoorah.  I love paperwork for the tax department.
<p>
<b>Support</b><BR>
Acting in a support role for a business who has their technical manager travelling around Europe for a month.  I get to answer both questions from the business and their clients.  So far this support has involved pointing out the space at the end of a filename, and listening to "but the note here says that if this happens I should do blah, but if I *do* blah, then....  Oh, it works.  Thanks Paul!"
<p>
<b>X-COM</b><BR>
Never played the original before, only X-COM 3.  Original X-COM rocks.
<p>
<b>Big filesystems</b><br>
Yup, it does takes <i>ages</i> to fsck 240Gb of drives.  Never again.  Ext3 is now in the server's kernel.
<p>
<b><a href="http://www.linuxchix.org/">LinuxChix</a></b><br>
Rocked up to a Melbourne get-together of LinuxChix.  I'm not on any of the mailing lists, but everyone seemed happy enough to have me there as the token male.  Lots of fun was had by all, and I was surprised that one person remembered me from rec.food.veg many many many years ago.  I'm looking forward to the next meeting.

I'm glad I got the UPS talking to the server again, just had our second power-outage in twelve hours.  Looks like the big gusts of wind are wrecking havoc with the power-grid.  Last night's lightning probably didn't help either.
<p>
Everything is working just as it should.  The server continues running for five minutes in case things get better, and my workstation falls flat on its face but recovers quickly due to ext3.  It also recovers quickly because all the important stuff (such as /home) is mounted on the server.  Hurrah hurrah.
<p>
<B>Camels</b><BR>
<a href="http://www.theage.com.au/">The Age</a> newspaper had <a href="/person/scottp/">scottp</a> and myself out at the Vic Market with camels on Sunday, taking photos.  They're running a small article on <a href="http://melbourne.pm.org">melb.pm</a>.  It seems that camels <i>really</i> like Scott.  I'm hoping they'll publish a photo of the camel giving Scotty a big sloppy kiss.
<p>
<B>Work</b><BR>
AIIIIEEEEE!!!!  Just when you thought it couldn't get any busier, it does!  There's a good chance that myself and a client's ISP representative will be placed into the ring to fight it out regarding certain networking problems that they've been experiencing.
<p>
I'm looking forward to December <i>so much</i>.  Everyone goes on holiday in December, right?
<p>
<B>Trees</b><BR>
Some good friends dropped around a Hazelnut tree the other day, claimed it was an engagement present.  I love trees, and I love hazelnuts, so I'm very happy.
<p>
<b>Wireless</b><BR>
Have the antenna, have the card on-way.  Getting cables sorted out.  The card and antenna nicely works out to be just under the legal limits on power-output, handy that.
