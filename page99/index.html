            <B>The resurrection</b><BR>
After almost of month of calling data recovery houses, 
searching on ebay, negotiating with second hand merchants 
from overseas, and general waiting for the post, my 
replacement drive arrived today.
<P>
Popped the new drive into my machine, formatted it, ran a 
few tests.  Yup, it works.
<P>
Pulled it out, swapped the dead controller on my old drive 
with the controller from the new drive.  Plugged it in, 
booted, ran fdisk.  Oh my goodness, the partition table in 
intact.  I'm so lucky.
<p>
Mount the drive.  Wow, the superblock is still intact.  
Read the data from the drive.  That's all there too.
<p>
Managed to recover every single file on the toasted drive.  
Very very very happy Paul.  Cost, about $AU100 vs $AU1000 
for professional data recovery.
<p>
Moral of the story: Keep backups of your junk drives.  Just 
because you wouldn't put anything of value on your squid 
cache drive, doesn't mean that you won't (in a moment of 
stupidity) decide it's a good place to store your six years 
worth of mail archives.
<p>
<B>Other News</b><BR>
I have a great new way of making money using my computer 
and the internet!  I can work from home, set my own hours, 
and earn TAX-FREE income.  Yes, it really does work!
<p>
No, I'm not going to tell you what it is.  If everyone was 
doing it, then I wouldn't be able to make anywhere near as 
much.

            <B>Massive Filesystem Corruption</b><BR>
At about 10am this morning, the power supply on the main
server failed.  This has happened once before, and to be
honest the novelty of fitting a not-quite-the-same power
supply into the case was wearing a bit thin.  I did it
nonetheless, using an old supply from a 386 that had been
hanging around just waiting to be made useful again.
<p>
With the new power-supply in place, it was discovered that
only two of the three disks were responding.  Hmm, very odd.
 Locate faulty disk, remove, check over...
<p>
Oh my.  Chips on the drive controller aren't supposed to
bubble like that, are they?  And boy does it smell bad! 
That's okay, that drive was just /var, and I can live
without my log files and proxy cache.  After all, that's why
I've made backups of the other two disks but not this one.
<p>
Except that /var contains the all-important /var/spool/mail,
/var/cvs, Debian package information, and some databases.  A
bit of an ouch there.
<p>
It was only later that I discovered that I had my last six
years worth of mail also on said hard-drive, since it had
more space than the other disks.  That was the crushing blow.
<p>
As it happens, the blowing power-supply also managed to
cause damage to the motherboard/CPU/RAM as well, since init
would segfault upon startup.  Changing the Mobo/CPU/RAM
fixed the problem.  I'll be testing sticks of memory to see
which ones can be recovered.
<p>
Moral of the story, backup everything, even the stuff you
don't care about, in case there's some stuff you do care
about in there as well.
<p>
It looks like the drive's controller is dead, but the
platters and mechanism inside are still okay.  Tried
replacing the controller with a similar model from a drive
that has busted insides, but to no avail.  It *tries* to
spin the drive up and all, but is obviously expecting
something else.  I think if I can find an identical
controller (old-ish Qantum fireball) I should be fine.  I'm
hoping that one of these professional data recovery joints
has a big box of them.

RIP Boor'yall.  She dropped off the perch (quite literally)
Saturday morning.
<p>
<B>Karaoke</b><BR>
Once again I'm amazed by some of the things that exist in
the world.  On Friday myself and some friends were looking
for a Karaoke bar in order to do a bit of singing.  We found
one promising looking place and entered.  The group had a
couple of Japanese exchange students in it, so we wanted to
find a bar that had a good multilingual selection.  This
place <i>looked</i> like it should.
<p>
Upon entering, I was very politely informed that this is the
sort of bar which has "ladies to sit with you, and since you
have your own ladies, there wouldn't be much point...", and
"yes, it is a karaoke bar, but more of a <i>gentleman's
club</i> karaoke bar".
<p>
We didn't stay, but we did spend a fair bit of time
disbelieving the bar and wondering if it really was true.
<p>
<b>Toy</b><br>
My palm m505 arrived the other day.  It's been very handy in
planning and prioritizing.  It's also shown me that I'm much
much more busy than I thought I was previously.

            <B>Wireless keyboard/mouse</b><BR>
New wireless keyboard and mouse (made by A4 tech) arrived
today, and they work beautifully.  I can type from another
room and all works fine.  Considering the purchae of another
set for the second machine, since they're just so darn handy
and nice to use.
<p>
Apparently each keyboard and mouse has its own serial ID,
which the receiver can remember (and hence excluse all
others).  In theory this lets you run lots of wireless
keyboards/mice side-by-side, and while syncing your keyboard
to your receiver is an easy button-press, I can't quite
figure out how the mouse is done without software.  Even so,
the units have two channels they can operate on, so a second
keyboard/mouse combo should not be a huge problem.
<p>
<b>Mackay</b><BR>
Spent some time in sunny Queensland (Mackay area).  Took me
a day to get used to the heat and humidity, but very much
enjoyed myself after that.  Went ocean rafting, which was a
lot of fun, but I pretty much had to be dragged out of the
water at snorkling time.  Coral reefs are really pretty, and
all the stories you've heard about swimming with schools of
fish are true.
<p>
Also found the most perfect property imaginable up there. 
Hundreds of fruit trees, green pastures, house in perfect
ocndition, permanent creek, and an amazing swimming hole. 
Reasonably priced, too.  Trouble is, we're not really
looking at moving yet, and in order to purchase and move
we'd need to do a lot of employment, financial, and social
juggling.  I also doubt I can get a high-speed, low-latency
Internet connection in the middle of nowhere.  :)
<p>
<b>Work</b><br>
Lots of work to do.  Never rains it pours sort of thing. 
That's good, because it looks like I've got a secure line of
jobs lined up for the next 3-4 months.  No starving here.
<p>
<b>Investment</b><br>
Having looked at the farm in Mackay sparked a big session of
financial planning.  Found some great investment properties
in Mackay (excellent rental returns), but Mackay's property
prices aren't exactly moving, and the average price of units
fell a little over the last year.  Mackay's a small place,
so any statistics on prices there should be taken with a
large grain of salt.
<p>
Looking at properties closer to Melbourne, somewhat because
it's easier to get to (living in Melbourne at all), and
somewhat because of the high population and property value
growth.

            <B>UPS</b><BR>
After a bit of fiddling, the UPS finally works the way it
should.  Trial-and-error revealed what the functions were
for the various pins on the cable provided with the unit,
and <i>genpower</i> did the rest.  Teddybear (our server)
will now happily shut itself down on power failure and
switch itself (and the switch and the ADSL modem) off.  When
power is restored, everything comes back nicely.  No fscks
involved.
<p>
Anyone who purchases an UpSonic Power Guardian should know
that the attached cable can be treated as an "apc1-nt" by
genpower.  No doubt the Linux software that comes with the
unit also works.
