            <B>Smoking</b><BR>
I have an interesting dilemma at work.  Our new support
person, Kathryn, is an unsuccessful ex-smoker.  She gave up
for a while, but she's now buying and smoking cigarettes
again.  Since she wants to give up, I'd like to help Kathryn
beat her habit.  Unfortunately, it's hard to argue with
complete and utter unthinking physical addiction, and
nicotine addiction is about as strong as it gets.
<P>
I've never smoked, I've never had the desire, and I don't
intend to start.  I have had a family member die a painful
and protracted death from a smoking related illness, and I
don't think that experience is something I will ever
forget.  I can't think of very many worse ways to die.
<P>
I'm not an anti-smoking zealot, but if someone wants to give
up, then I'm seriously very happy to help them.  My dilemma
is that I don't know how.  I've tried taking Kathryn's
cigarettes, but she just buys more.  I've even offered to
trade her cigarettes for lollies and sugary things (Kathryn
has a sweet-tooth).  Alas, no luck so far.

            <B>Bughunting</b><BR>
<A HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/sw>Sam</a> managed to
find the REAL bug-of-doom that I had spent so long looking
for.  It ended up that our daemon had opened a couple of
unix-domain sockets before forking, and the children
inherited and used the open file descriptors.  Due to the
nature of the code this was okay during quiet periods, but
caused huge problems during load.  Sam was presented with
the Bugfinder's Beer and everyone is happy.  Good work Sam!
<P>
<B>Diplomacy</b><BR>
Very interesting turn.  It seemed that everyone lied to
everyone, and a very messy turn was had by all.  What fun! 
I'm looking forward to see how it all turns out.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
I'm very thankful to Jacinta for her work.  She's spent a
lot of time cleaning up code, making sure things are
consistant, and reviewing my hacker's guide and other
documentation.
<P>
I'm playing with Debianising Finance::Quote, although it
will probably be a while before I get the proper hang of
it.  I've got some examples to work by, so I'm using them.
<P>
<B>Cartooning</b><BR>
I'm once again walking the fine line and have restarted my
cartoons.

Watched <I>LG-5: City in Space</i>, a 3D movie at the IMAX
theatre.  The special effects were good, but the plot wasn't
great.
<P>
Watched <I>Episode I: The Phantom Menace</i> on tape.  The
special effects were good, but the movie SUCKED!  George
Lucas has certainly turned to the dark side, I'm sure of
it.  I delayed watching TPM for a long time because everyone
else told me it was bad, but I had no idea just how truly
bad it was.  Somehow I feel that <A
HREF=http://www.teleport-city.com/movies/reviews/bizarro/starwars.html>The
Star Wars Christmas Special</a> had to have been better than
this.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Got heaps of coding done over the weekend.  Still needs a
lot of polish before the next release, but we're certainly
getting there.  Haven't heard back from Jon about The Perl
Journal article I'm supposed to be writing yet.  Will send
him another letter about it.

            <B>CVS</b><BR>
I'm always amazed in interviews when people tell me that in
their previous jobs they didn't use a revision control
system.  I can't imagine doing any sort of serious coding
without CVS.  If I were any better friends with CVS then I'd
probably be sleeping with it.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Made a tiny branch for Finance::Quote 0.18, GnuCash
edition.  F::Q was originally part of GnuCash, and a few
months ago I
branched it off into its own development.  I still roll the
changes back into the GnuCash tree, but they require minor
changes here and there.  It's amazing how the words "feature
freeze" can get me to start hacking code again. :)
<P>
<B>Rockclimbing and Hackey-sack</b><BR>
Ian injured his arm playing hackey-sack.  I don't know how
that's possible, considering that you don't even use your
arms in hackey-sack, but Ian did it nonetheless.  As such,
he dropped out of climbing this week.  :(
<P>
<B>Perl</b><BR>
<I>Makes simple jobs easy, makes hard jobs possible</i>.  My
goodness, I really do love perl sometimes.  Just simple
things like being able to throw around references to
anonymous functions can really make a man's day.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Spent an entire day on things political.  I really didn't
join this company to spend my days arguing politics, I
actually joined it to code.  Unfortunately the culture,
values, and many other reasons why I joined have been
eroded.  Dan is coming back on Monday, and while I'm sure
he'll be able to fix some problems, he won't be able to fix
all of them.
<P>
I'm working on plans should the conditions at Schoolsnet
become unworkable, and how to try and stop the decline
before that happens.  I don't really want to leave -- I love
the people here and what's left of the culture, but at the
same time I don't want to be working for some corporate
juggernaut.
